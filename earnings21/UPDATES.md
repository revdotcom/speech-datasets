Added Rev and Kaldi.org outputs in the NLP format. These can be found in `outputs/rev/kaldi/nlp`, `outputs/rev/espnet/nlp`, and `outputs/kaldi_org/librispeech/nlp`. The old outputs are still available in `outputs/rev/kaldi/ctm`, `outputs/rev/espnet/text` and `outputs/kaldi_org/librispeech/ctm`

Fixed the outputs of the Kaldi.org, Librispeech model. These changes resulted in a change in the model's WER which can be seen in `transcripts/README.md`. The changes in this model's output does not change our conclusions.
