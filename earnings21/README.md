# File Format Overview
In the following section, we provide an overview of the file formats we provide with this dataset.

## nlp Files
NLP files are `.csv` inspired, pipe-separated text files that contain token and metadata information of a transcript. Each line of a file represents a single transcript token and the metadata associated with it.

|Column Title|Description
|--|--|
| Column 1: `token` | A single token in the transcript. These are typically single words or multiple words with hyphens in between. |
| Column 2: `speaker` | A unique integer that associates this token to a specific speaker in an audio |
Column 3: `ts`          |     A float representing the start time of the token, in seconds |
Column 4: `endTs`       |     A float representing the end time of the token, in seconds |
Column 5: `punctuation` |     A punctuation character that is included at the end of a token that is used when reconstructing the transcript. Example punctuation: `",", ";", ".", "!"`. |
Column 6: `case`  | A two letter code to denominate the which of four possible casings for this token: <ul><li>`UC` - Denotes a token that has the first character in uppercase and every other character lowercase.</li><li>`LC` - Denotes a token that has every character in lowercase.</li><li>`CA` - Denotes a token that has every character in uppercase.</li><li>`MC` - Denotes a token that doesnâ€™t follow the previous rules. This is the case when upper- and lowercase characters are mixed throughout the token</li></ul> |
Column 7: `tags`        |     Displays one of the several entity tags that are listed in wer_tags in long form - such that the displayed entity here is in the form `ID:ENTITY_CLASS`. |
Column 8: `wer_tags`    |     A list of entity tags that are associated with this token. In this field, only entity IDs should be present. The specific ENTITY_CLASS for each ID can be extracted from an accompanying wer_tags sidecar json. |

_**Note that each entity ID is unique to that specific entity. Entities can be comprised of single and multiple tokens. Within a file there can be several entities of the same ENTITY_CLASS but only one entity can be labeled with any given ID.**_


### Example nlp File
`example.nlp`

```
token|speaker|ts|endTs|punctuation|case|tags|wer_tags
Good|0||||UC|[]|[]
morning|0||||LC|['5:TIME']|['5']
and|0||||LC|[]|[]
welcome|0||||LC|[]|[]
to|0||||LC|[]|[]
the|0||||LC|['6:DATE']|['6']
first|0||||LC|['6:DATE']|['6']
quarter|0||||LC|['6:DATE']|['6']
2020|0||||CA|['0:YEAR']|['0', '1', '6']
NexGEn|0||||MC|['7:ORG']|['7']
```

## wer_tag JSON
The wer_tags sidecar JSON is used in combination with an nlp file and exclusively when that file is using the wer_tags column. It is used to provide entity information about each entity ID. It is formatted such that the JSON acts as a list of objects that map the ID of an entity to an object specifying the entity_type as the entity label. The object is formatted such that:

```
"ID":{
  "entity_type" : "LABEL"
}
```

### Example wer_tag JSON
`example.wer_tags.json`

```
{
  "0":{
    "entity_type" : "YEAR"
  },
  "1":{
    "entity_type" : "CARDINAL"
  },
  "5":{
    "entity_type" : "TIME"
  },
  "6":{
    "entity_type" : "DATE"
  },
  "7":{
    "entity_type" : "ORG"
  }
}
```

# Results
Tables found in the paper along with all entity class WER can be found within the `transcripts` directory.

# WER Calculation
All of our analysis on this dataset is done through the use of our newly released [fstalign](https://github.com/revdotcom/fstalign/tree/master) tool. We strongly recommend the use of this tool to quickly get started using the *Earnings-21* dataset.
