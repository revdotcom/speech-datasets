all chief executive officer and good morning to everyone on the call i would like to kick off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by covid nineteen and all the dedicated healthcare workers for responders and volunteers who are on the frontline all over the world battling this pandemic i would also like to take a moment to say sincere thank you to all of the angers or grand employees around the world the pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have a left it to the new realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers every day i hear new examples of our businesses providing mission critical products to our customers and i am proud of what our company represents and how employees have responded to these unprecedented times but there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future one thing i am sure about is that english overland will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and her work of all of our employees mostly five i would like to ground everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times when we close the transaction a little over two months ago because i've never anticipated that within a matter of weeks we will be dealing with a global pandemic causing disruptions to our customers supply chain and the day-to-day operations of the company a response speaks to how the rx took it has effectively helped us a plan accelerate and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities first ensuring the safety of our employees customers and the community second around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times and finally continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation the strength of english or brand team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis as younger and more unified company the next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine that we call ix are really at the heart of how we operate as a company especially in these unprecedented times during the integration process we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose one that is centered around our stakeholders where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better this purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams leave on a daily basis creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the ingress around execution excellence process the simplicity and the activeness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across english or run during july seven i would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the covid nineteen crisis since it had been switched and focus around two major components first is a health and safety and wellbeing of our employees customers and communities and second business continuity not only within operations but across the larger supply chain starting first with health of safety we activated our covid nineteen tax force in february and had a full coordinated company approach in early march just weeks after the creation of the new company our execution approach has served us very well as we're able to quickly implement and have site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely and it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than thirty confirmed cases of covid nineteen among are more than seventeen thousand global employee base but it's more than just implementing safety protocols it's also a supported and engaging the employee base as a result we have implemented a number of measures include a global average program to solicit employee feedback our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than two hundred suggestions when we ask for cost savings ideas not only did our team volunteer take individual pay cuts furloughs and for good vacation time this year they have thoughtful in depth suggestions many which we're actively implementing today from a business continuity perspective starting first with our operations as we previously communicated we have seen plans largely in china italy and india impacted due to covid nineteen china was largely impacted in the month of january in february and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through march and into april as things are now largely back to normal be telling india so about a two month line to china with operations being impacted in late march and into april and in this time our sites around the globe are ninety eight percent operational with india still being the most impacted due to governmental risk actions on returning to work the supply chain has seen a similar trend as the impact in china is largely behind us and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues the americas and emea regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the with and italy have started to come back online in the past few weeks we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions we're possible much like operations in the it seems to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain and we expect the situation to improve in the later half of may when governmental restrictions begin to use we are addressing the current environment head on by actively managing those areas within our control so let me tell you about what we're doing here starting with slide eight through the use of rx we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over three hundred fifty million dollars with increases across all made your saving categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity as a reminder we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost energies of approximately two hundred fifty million by the end of year three after closing we expect to include approximately four hundred fifty million dollars of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies and the associated standup of the new company as we have stated multiple times over the past recorders the facing of synergy delivery was always an area we believe we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done we have dramatically increased the pace having already executed on ninety million dollars of annualized structural cost reductions with the product million seventeen million savings expected to be delivered in twenty twenty the majority of the savings are coming from head connections already taken in the past two months as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization in addition we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiative with rfqs for nearly one third of our historical direct material span base already launched as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed into we're now expecting to deliver approximately thirty five percent of our overall synergy target in twenty twenty which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of ten to fifteen percent realization we're keeping the overall cost energy target at two hundred fifty million over three year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume dependent synergies like procurement and i to be given the current environment it is not only the structural cost that we have taken out but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short term cost reductions to protect margins so let's move to slide nine to talk about that in q1 despite the fifteen percent relative decline that we saw collectively across the business on a proformal basis we were able to limit adjusted ebita documentals to less than thirty percent with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments we expected this at this in all actions would you forty to fifty million dollars of incremental cost savings in the pnl this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter we will continue to a reevaluate on a monthly basis and if the main environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our statements to get accordingly but we're making some top decisions to control cost one area that we're not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise much like we did back in two thousand fifteen at georgia denver when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share games and new product opportunities we're following the same playbook today investments in r and d are being maintained at similar levels as prior years and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as demand generation and our iot platforms this is all part of the strategy to play offense now especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration moving to slide ten let me talk about liquidity the company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity at the time of the merger we took the opportunity to reprise our legacy debt but placing the new one point nine million dollar term loan to close this transaction all of our debt is a term loan-based structure with very attractive pricing as the u s components are library plus one seventy five and the year component is a year ago close two hundred the term loans have no financial governance from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until twenty twenty seven liquidity also remains strong at one point six billion dollars as we finish the quarter with five hundred and fifty six million dollars of cash on the balance sheet and over a billion dollars of capacity on our existing credit facilities as we look ahead we continue to see several opportunities to own the cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity opportunities exists across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year as all eight hundred twenty five million dollars of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by september of twenty two empty even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles given the attractive rate and covenant environment turning to slide eleven our commitment to our new entering strategy remains unwavering you have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy as we're building the culture of english or brand with our employees at the court we will continue to act quickly and proudly to protect margins and preserve liquidity and at the same time we will position the company for future growth both organically and through opportunistic targeted both on emit our business operates in the very fragmented markets and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio and importantly our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launch several of our esg or into initiatives already overall we have several value creation levels as we look ahead and we will continue to execute despite the uncertain micro economic landscape i will now turn it over to emily to walk you through the financials emily thanks for sending on slide twelve you will see the as reported financials for the company as a remind under the reported financials include three months of legacy gardner denver and one month of the legacy <unk> industrial segment in q1 twenty twenty and only the legacy gardner denver businesses in q of twenty nineteen as a result the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction and we'll spend a lot of time on this page as a result other than to mention that the as reported net income in the court includes a hundred and ninety seven million dollars of amortization acquisition restructuring and other adjustments which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation turning of slide thirteen to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of january one twenty eighteen from a total company perspective fx adjusted revenue and orders declined fourteen percent and seven percent respectively and were impacted by covid nineteen regionally we saw notable declines in asia pacific as well as sharp decline in the us and europe towards the end of the quarter most notably in the itns segment this led book to bill to finish at one point one one for the quarter the company delivered two hundred and eight million of adjusted ebitda a decline of twenty four percent driven mostly by the volume declines in itns and the expected downturn in the hps segments adjusted ebitda margins were sixteen point four per sent down two hundred basis points from last year however our proactive cost controls within the business limited detrimental to twenty nine percent in terms of adjusted ebita composition for the company the legacy gardner denver business delivered ninety seven million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately a hundred million which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment the legacy i our businesses delivered fifty one million of adjusted event on march as opposed to a combined sixty million for january and february moving the slide fourteen free cash flow for the quarter with sixty million dollars on an reported basis including eight million of capex the q1 free cash flow includes sixty three million of outflows related to the transactions comprised of thirty eight million of synergy delivery and end up related costs and another twenty five million of transaction fees we also paid thirty eight million of debt issuance costs in the corner which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement bringing our total to is action related outflows in the quarter to a hundred million from a leverage perspective we finished at two point six times and while we do expect to see some short term increase to leverage we have shown the ability to the lever historically as you can see on the right side of the page will remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically specifically internal reinvestments for growth prudent debt pay down an opportunistic bolt on m and a we have no plans for any share re purchases or a dividend at this time i'll now turn it back to the center to walk through the segments the center thanks emily starting first uh with in those two technologies and services on july fifteenth the itnn segment first quarter adjusted order intake was eight hundred eighty nine million dollars down nine percent versus prior year excluding effects and just a revenue in the quarter where seven hundred ninety six million down seventeen percent excluding effects and leading to a book to build ratio of one point one two times from original perspective if asia pacific revenues were down in the mid thirties with europe down fifteen percent and america is down seven percent all excluding effects we use this trending as an indication of how q2 could potentially play out meaning that the apac the clinic q1 is what we expect to see in america's anemia in the near term this is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business but we're seeing highly active with the main generation activities and pricing controls but we continue to demonstrate discipline in price generating over one percent in the quarter but these markets are more uppaid than historically we're using our unique data acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment we write this out into two areas after market and original equipment for after market and leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to our remote monitoring systems in america in europe we saw a sharp decline in compressive utilization in the last three weeks of march of nearly thirty percent with some recovery in the past three weeks of april we're not using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus while same time using it as a leading indicator for after market activity which is approximately fifty percent of the compressor business today for original equipment we're using the man generation leads we said in the past that the mansion was the leading indicator of orders that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks with more than a thousand lists per week we have a lot of commercial insight in our system what we saw in the letter weeks of march with a drop of thirty percent versus what we saw earlier in the quarter with similar trends in america and europe we have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of april but still approximately twenty to twenty five percent off from the heights in the early part of the year let me give you now some color from a product line perspective we have seen very similar trends across compressors blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single digits we have spoken about third party industry reports in the past and the key one data speaks well for the outcome the combining of the two companies according to a leading third party report the market in the us was down many single digits in dollars in the first quarter garner denver branded products were flat and english or branded product was down high single digits but when you look into the details you'll see the power of the two companies have grown november so good share gains on low to medium host power machines while english iran took share on high horse power compressors this was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal and with it is as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channels that both companies have power tools and lift which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over twenty percent the business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue however this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market many online retailers so they're focused to household essentials moving to non-gap at just <unk> itns delivered a hundred and thirty five million dollars in the quarter which was down twenty five percent non-gap at just <unk> margin was seventeen percent which was down a hundred fifty it's points from the entire year of our cause mitigation efforts helped limit decremental to twenty five percent in a segment that typically has made decrementals of thirty five to forty percent before cause actions moving to slide sixteen the proficient and science technology segment overall the segment had solely performance in these economic environment as adjusted orders were two hundred eighty million of two percent x effects adjusted revenue was a hundred ninety two million down nine percent x effects of strong prior year comes of twelve percent x effects growth and shipping delays due to covid nineteen this platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets in the first quarter we saw orders growth high single digits in the legacy medical pump business as we are leading key players in several applications like oxygen concentrators respirators and liquid handling you can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into at the bottom of the page our team have been working twenty four seven providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to find covid nineteen now and in the future the remainder of the portfolio so slightly negative orders performance down two percent and x effect with the majority due to covid lockdowns in january and february in china and towards the end of the quarter in india what is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals which will help balance some of the effective weaknesses in a more industrial and markets moving to non-gap adjusted ebita pnfc delivered fifty three million dollars in the quarter which is down six percent non-gap adjusted ebita mark it was twenty seven point seven percent up a hundred twenty basis points driven by strong cost controls and productivity leading to detrimental margins of only fifteen percent moving to slide seventeen and the specialty eco technology segment the priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner we see that these segment can expand margins with the use of the same irx tools we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of these and moving forward having said that this business performed very well in the first quarter adjusted orders were two hundred thirteen million dollars and adjusted revenue was a hundred eighty five million dollars of eight percent and seventy percent respectively with a book to bill or one point one five growth was driven by the strength in gold connectivity and consumer problems the business saw strong double digit order momentum in early january in february but the pandemic hit the us we saw sharp decline in the second half of march but there is a lot to be excited about we're expecting q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons first last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter where some product was shifted to the second quarter of two thousand nine in and two the business is not immune to this current environment while april orders were down here a year we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders we feel this is driven by a couple factors first in the consumer product line team people to quickly to leveraging demand generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate and second with the work we have done a proactive college prevention across all of our locations we were able to remain open while some of our competitors were closed moving to non-gap adjusted ebita specialty vehicles deliver eighteen million dollars in the quarter down one percent non-gap adjusted ebita was nine point nine percent which was down eighty basis points due to strategic growth investments and product mix moving to slide eighteen and the high pressure solution segment in the business perform above our expectations in a tough operating environment with justed orders of eighty four million and adjusted revenues of ninety six million down twenty six percent and twenty nine percent respectively i suspected the revenue base in the business was nearly ninety percent after market and the team executed very well commercial with sequential adjusted orders of six percent and sequential adjusted revenues of twenty six percent versus a fourth quarter of two thousand nineteen we continue to see share gain opportunities in after market and specifically consumables where we saw orders and everything up double digits sequentially this allowed us to deliver non-gap adjusted ebita of twenty four million dollars on margins of twenty four point six percent which was down from last year level of thirty point eight percent but sequentially better by over four hundred excess point as we people to the second quarter and rest of the year a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity we can make sure that in multiple ways but the simplest form is a number of fleets operational in the market as a reminder each frack fleet has about sixteen to eighteen trucks with each truck carrying one pump each pump has a fluid and every fluid and utilizes consumables or q1 of twenty twenty on average we saw three hundred eighteen active fleets the ex rate in march was two hundred and forty we expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter where we believe fifty actively due to the recent dynamics in the market with the over supply and lower pricing for oil info impact on revenues within this segment and because of that we're taking very proactive stand to drive the proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come moving to nine nineteen we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of all the all the total companies down approximately twenty percent in orders that a month began very low particularly in us and european mark but the order momentum throughout april we expect total revenue to be low in terms of orders both industrial technology and services and specialty vehicle segments we're writing line with a total company average what precision and science technology is performing considerably better with positive year over year orders performance those are as a result of continuous strength in medical pumps and not surprisingly the high pressure solution segment is down as a market reset for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters as we look forward due to the uncertain number that we find ourselves in we will not be providing q2 or total year to best manage our business and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impact on cash flows a current model shows that the business will an annual basis to be cash flow break even using fairly conservative assumptions around working capital and capital call with the cost actions we have taken those far we feel that these puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compare to current order trends and couple with our current liquidity position current is like twenty for some concluding marks i want to say that what we manage through what we will know that that would be a tough second quarter we feel that that from the mental investment pieces in the company has not changed i think it is a premier industrial company of our transformation we have multiple levers for accelerating value creation or being very focused on the current our liquidity with opportunities to increase this by on-looking cash as well as taking it back of the current rate environment we will continue to drive a culture of execution and we continue to pay attention to the particularly on the current conditions to be strategic on both on acquisitions with <unk> at this time i would like to remind everyone in order to ask a question number one on your telephone key pad if you would like to remove yourself from the queue you may press the pound yourself to one question and your first question comes from andy capitalits from city group your line is open the morning guy how are you good morning andy good to you the sunday can you give us more color into the april order declined you're seeing in your largest segment in nineteen s first of all how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tool business they'll have you know smaller options that exposure in its so are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses uh given it's they're more project versus the industrial compressor uh yeah andy let me just give you a little bit of color i mean as you saw we said roughly you know april total orders down twenty percent book to build greater than one uh from a book to build perspective you know the uh industrial technology and the uh position on science where we're greater uh than one and obviously leading the way uh i'll say you know in terms of in terms of ideas in particular you know i will categorize it as you know the uh the short cycle with mostly most impacted in the course and continue to see uh you know some relatively weakness uh here uh moving forward i mean it's it's it's mostly core related to uh i guess maybe the pmi uh you know from uh from the down in the mainstream which is what we consider to be more on the loan cycle uh i'll say you know comparatively a bit more stable uh in the first quarter and uh and and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of april uh again typically we tend to get the orders for that loan cycle now in the first half of the year in order to get shipments uh in the second half uh and uh and and and from a ptl from a power two perspective yeah i mean rough rough quarter in the in the in the in in q1 uh as as i alluded i mean last year they were seen some fairly good growth momentum from uh their expansion into online retailers and uh and you saw that uh in the first quarter many of these online retail retailers they moved uh to have another kind of more household goods or critical need to fight covid uh covid nineteen and clearly you know this business uh saw some of the impact i'll say april sale is uh relatively low so we haven't seen the uh the uh the people of the momentum of uh of the powerful business so that's helpful of the same thing and i'm sure you you expect us to ask about detrimental margin in some way so so let me just ask it like this some obviously you know good result in q1 of close to thirty you know how do i think about detrimentals with high pressure solution and you know the orders down eighty percent can you hold detrimentals there in the mid forties at what point you know that fixed costs become a problem i know you talked about accelerate the rest of the business and the rest of the business hold the eighty percent that's from mental with the twenty percent decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business yeah so i'll say andy i mean that's that's kind of what we're targeting for and uh uh i mean as you have seen you know we have performed well in the down cycles in the past uh i think we have a good solid playbook that we that we executed in the in the fifteen sixteen that included both not only in industrial downturn but also uh an upstream downturn uh you know basic mentals they tend to be around forty percent across a business with uh slightly higher in uh in businesses like uh uh the high pressure as you mentioned as well as the uh precision and science because of the nice uh high growth margins that both businesses have and you know lower on the specialty vehicles and uh the industrial technologies they tend to play in that kind of forty forty percent range uh you know you're seeing that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short term actions uh to protect the margin uh we saw as you mentioned you know some very good first quarter results for the total business on their thirty percent and q2 we clearly see a bit more pressure from a top line perspective but we will continue to manage the ecrementals with the target being closer closer to that thirty percent uh of uh of uh of of of the data and you know when you think about the actions we're we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions in the high pressure uh around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and uh and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that good much to have very helpful to sunday stay well thank you you're doing it your next question comes from julie and mitchell from barclays your line is open hi good morning um more good morning maybe just a first question on that point on detrimental margins so if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year and also of that forty to fifty million that of other cost out actions and do those mean that detrimental margins narrow or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things maybe break it down into the two buckets uh as you suggested me on the forty to fifty that we spoke about uh that are kind of more related to uh discretionary or kind of volume related those are largely second quarter in a third quarter uh with a good one your r t l a more more so on the uh on the second quarter uh from a from the cost synergy perspective million dollars uh i mean i don't know the eighty to ninety million dollars of in year um you know roughly account and i would say that is kind of consistent third quarter and fourth quarter while the other roughly you know ten to twenty million dollars that comes from procurement it is really more weighted towards that kind of q3 thank you for and then maybe just my second question for you offer emily around the free cash flow we had a good performance in q1 uh i just wondered you know you have you have some assumptions around brexit even free cash but as soon play out um you know what kind of you know sales are down called it twenty twenty five to sense for the year what type of free cash flow conversion should we expect you know how do you see working capital moving you had i think in the free cash that sixty three million dollars of transact and separation cash cost in q1 what's the rough assumption for the year um yeah very pleased with with the q1 cash performance as you as you saw or julian and we've been managing cash um you know from to put in good processes and strong controls around it uh given the current crisis we we we expect cash to still be to move forward but certainly a longer cash side as we move through um and we're really managing you know payments as to the collections we're receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions um you know what the future holds um a lot of that's you know gonna depend on time um for sure but we know we maintain our cash position in our liquid and how about the costs any very rough guideline post for the year uh in light of that sixty three million in q1 well be some some incremental um i don't have the i don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment julian but i can get back to you on that your next question comes from michael hollering from there morning everyone hope everyone's doing well so so could we just talk about the the synergy funnel referenced you know what what are some of the incremental sources that originally identified two hundred fifty maybe talk about the difference you're seeing you know longer term some of the have any synergy opportunities you see the uh as you recall you know we also said that uh that we were going for uh you know we were sixty days into uh into into so into the transaction we have all these very visibility as to what that phone could uh could could potentially be probably a hundred million dollars comes from a combination of structural savings uh rationalization kind of none on a financial alluded to uh on the investors we have now a pretty good database of all the uh the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for to really understand and rationalize uh not so much the coming year two year three but more more the uh the other kind of perspective so so um second part of the question um liquidity is in a strong position um you know some of the the one off things is operation um you know some of the extra things emily just referenced what would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the with the cash out flow and then um secondary related to that that we're going into some sort of recession here who knows how long this opportunity is gonna accelerate to the click apple more towards the m and a side of things over the next couple of years and how you positioned for that today and any kind of thoughts and how you're you're thinking humidly about the the capital side over the next six nine plus months yeah no absolutely mike i mean i think uh you know clearly over the next couple years uh continue to be a really part of our strategy uh you know we see it's a very unique environment right now uh we still see at this point in time some very good funnel on also very good funnel around you know industrial technologies but there are really more related towards bottoms thank you your next question comes from nigel co from wolf research your line is open good morning how are you guys good yeah good thanks um i'll take performance so a little bit performer performance uh it seems like most of that came from the legacy ir businesses um can you maybe just kind of spell out in a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the jibs of the industrial of the also what happens to service during the quarter like what happened to what yeah what what happens to our service yeah yeah i think uh uh tell china was definitely impacted largely in in in january and february uh the legacy ir business they have uh a pretty sizable uh china exposure uh uh you know in terms of in terms of the service uh you know we we we saw service better typically typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective better performance than than the original equipment and just to kind of give you maybe a a little bit more color here uh particularly as you know ways of comparing some of the you know the industrial technology is composed of multiple technologies compressors backings and blowers and uh personal business is clearly within the when we specifically compare to some of the compared third couple of data points that we look at the third party report uh at the same time you know just to give you further perspective the legacy gardner denver business in q1 orders were down in the low single so in the market and uh you know since since we since we didn't own the legacy ir for the full quarter uh we just and to not comment on what we saw specifically you know january and february that they saw from an order perspective but that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to have form even on the legacy d great thanks so much this is <unk> business this i think it becomes so small now that it's almost involvement but if if if if it is down eight percent in the quarter it implies you know that you know i mean is it possible to to break given your clear expect thing that business to to be kind of like weaker for longer uh yeah would you expect revenues to kind of like just bounce on the truck here for the next several quarters i mean any any kind of that would be helpful yeah and like also so for sure you know that's what we're targeting to be you know the break even even even positive uh i mean we're taking some pretty pretty aggressive actions a hundred percent after marketing consumable so that that kind of carries a much better uh mark and profile too as well and you know those factories that are kind of not uh not not uh needed based on volume i mean we're basically keeping them uh close or very very low uh exposure so here a good playbook on how how to we have done extensive work and uh you know i think we we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long term and our plan is that is gonna be down for a while uh and and and to the second question you know i mean clearly is a is a market that as you saw we just invested in a new fluid and technology so you know we can be ready for capturing so great thanks very much our next question comes from jeff <unk> from vertical research partners thank you good morning everyone um i want to just why don't we just come back to service for a moment the center uh interesting comment about uh utilization down from uh thirty percent but how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward sales are gonna be down thirty percent into service i don't believe i dunno if you have enough data historically uh to kind of piece that together but what does that down thirty percent tell you yeah jeff a great question i mean so in terms of the historical data we don't have a lot of historical because as you know as you can imagine a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the iot platforms that we both companies have now uh is fairly new uh but we have enough data to to then break it down by the specific uh uh sub end market the indication here is that it's telling us where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective so it's helping us to redirect the teams it is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective you know in terms in terms of being down thirty percent uh i mean i think we just see that as as a bit of indication as to what could happen here uh but as you give us a great correct we don't have a lot of historical data to so what we're doing is just taking that data point to be focusing them on those areas regions and markets that uh that we're still seeing some data a good utilization of their compressors and and and the answers you noted ips obviously includes more than compressors are you suggesting that uh was other third products there areas outside of that teams and growers were substantial yeah so for sure yeah so i mean for sure the uh the top part tool and the listing business uh was one that it was worse than that uh i mean the power tools is that uh they have uh two main product lines i mean it's that tools business but also they have uh a lift in business uh that it's kind of more related to to factory consumption or factory uh rationalization so i think you know that that was impacted uh more so uh and then china as a region was definitely uh uh heavily impacted uh and uh you know from uh from the other product lines in terms of the longer cycle uh which these are kind of brand like <unk> liquid green ponds and liquid green vacuums those are more longer cycle and those were i'll say more stable and resilient great thank you your next question comes from david russo from evercore isi your line is open good morning uh my question's about in the its inventory and the channel and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen can you give us some sense on any sequential improvement sort of a lead lag and also the mix of your business as being short cycle versus long cycle can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels the lag you would need to see or that you would experience if say the pmis got better for example uh yeah i mean i think you know when when when we look at the inventory in those channels uh i mean there's just no idea from a from a compressor perspective which is obviously the one that has the biggest sides of the distribution network and and it is also more particularly towards the garner denver branded products uh you know what don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these these are particularly smaller distributors more sub-regionalized uh more localized they don't tend to to put a lot of cash up front to have compressors on the shell so to speak i mean maybe on this other compressors they they may uh put down on the medium to high level compressors and and the inventory will come in more on consumables after market and really move fairly uh fairly well i mean they turn fairly quickly you've seen just home clear is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in its or have you seen some little improvement in order sequentially and i'd be curious is that more short cycle a long cycle yeah no yeah great question yeah it is i'll i'll categorize it as a step stabilization and uh initially and then obviously when you look at it within the month i mean at the month of april you know there's some uh sliding improvement on the second have a very program but again was that more short cycle improvement short cycle yeah yeah short cycle all right thank you thank you very much appreciate it sure your next question comes from john <unk> is open hi good morning all morning josh um so this is the day i guess you know everyone here on the call kind of the same list of questions so we covered a lot of ground already um but i guess you know just with some of the commentary around utilization um and with the comments you made around supply chain interruption how much of the decline did you seeing and yeah i guess this comment is mostly an its comment is related to you know customer shutdowns or supply chain interruption in in some form like you know the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back cause i i to some of these points on you know service or utilization that maybe that's not the the steady state you know state of the world there yeah just i'll say more so uh in in in china uh if you want to think about it kind of that to disruption uh completely uh also in the in the first quarter maybe some disruption uh from the perspective of uh in europe particularly in italy uh i mean we do have some very good manufacturing days in italy uh and and we although we stayed operationally i mean most of our suppliers had to shut down uh uh i would say that uh now uh as kind of the comment that i made before we see kind of this lower demand level kind of getting more stabilized uh but uh you know feel uh you know not seeing that uh that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will will play out okay and then switching over to the uh to the synergy funnel i mean it sounds like the the year three um you know pipeline of activity you know can i ask to stay there as you know act on other things first since more manufacturing centric fair to say that the incremental step up in synergy then into year two is it's smaller i guess it's you know is this more of a pull forward from year two or are you kind of implicitly saying hey we think there's more than two fifty here we're just you know we're working on this as fast as we can and update us we know more yeah i mean i think that's expecting the case we think we think uh we want to keep it at two fifty just cause we think it's prudent uh and we think it's prudent because we're we're i mean clearly focused on a lot of the uh internal funnel and execution you see how we accelerate it and we execute it i mean this is not just talking about the executed but there's a component around procurement and uh and uh and itv savings uh innovative value that is long independent and when we did a two hundred fifty million dollar cost energy funnel it it's on based on two thousand nineteen kind of uh uh runway level so to speak on spend levels so we just want to be prudent from uh from kind of going out there and saying that the two fifty will increase uh you know once we're we're ready we'll definitely and when we see kind of more stability or not market normalization in the markets maybe we come back with that but at this point in time we're we're accelerating what we can control and we know that we can control that structural head counts out and that's exactly what we executed we know we can control a lot of the quick ins in procurement is commodity is our lower and we are executed in that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed so we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute great appreciate the car to look at it your next question comes from nathan jones from steeple your line is open morning everyone what do you think okay uh you know revenue down eight point six step x margins up a hundred and twenty basis points so clearly some very good control lack on what drove the very good sacramentals there uh how you see the sacramentals going forward and and maybe any color you can give us a what you think the long term margin opportunities in that business yeah and this is uh uh uh you know i would say some very good cost control but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical uh business if you remember as year when we talked about the medical business we were seeing upwards of two hundred business points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly you know thirty thirty one percent uh ebita margin so again very good momentum from that business and and clearly as we saw so i'm suddenly in the market the team continued to execute those uh targets that they needed that needed to needed to get done you know i think it when when when when when you look at this business that uh i mean has some very nice growth margins and uh you know the detrimental that they the decrementals are typically you know forty five or so i mean pretty good job that the team did here in order to get a decremental down to the fifteen percent uh and i'll say you know from a long term perspective we'll we'll definitely come come back uh with with with giving some kind of medium to long in perspective i'll just do a quick comparison then you can see that medical we were able to uh you know not not only you know just a few years ago that medical business wasn't the twenty five twenty six percent ebitton margin and we finished you know last year the thirty one percent ebitton margin and there's just a lot good commonalities between the medical and the legacy uh you know pfs and ar business that are within this segment okay maybe just uh one unreceivables um when you look through that do you see any customer credit risk any collection risk there i guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way given the way that market's going but anywhere else you see you know any potential issues in receivables how you're going about managing customer credit those kinds of things i mean i'll say not necessarily nathan i mean i think it's it's one that we we we we we live by day by day i mean clearly the uh on the uh on the high purchase solution which is as you mentioned the most exposed i mean customers are still pain uh they take longer to pay but they still pay uh you know they they they also realize that uh you know from an option perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again so uh we have been pretty strict in uh in many cases that uh that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we see to uh to to provide any type of uh any type of uh output products either now or later in the in the future so i think we're we're we're we're we're really excited in a good label here on on collections with the teams excellent thank you thank you your next question comes from nicole delays from deutsche bank your line is open uh yeah thanks good morning guys coming to go um so a lot of this has been answer we've covered a lot of ground so far but i just wanted to ask one um into next year as we think about you know approaching or recovery there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here we've got you know more structural call savings coming through presumably you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business and then just kind of downtailing all of that with typical incremental margins i'm not sure you know how best you can do this this sunday but it would be really you know helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out you know on the other side of this downturn yeah i don't think so yeah that's great i mean i think i think you know we typically see kind of the base uh what i call the base level of incremental to be you know for the total business between thirty five to forty percent uh again you know when you look at uh precision and science maybe higher than that uh specialty vehicles uh lower than that with maybe industrial technologies about that level uh you know definitely we'll we'll we'll see a little bit of a headwind uh as we see a lot of these uh structural activities that we're doing to come to fruition uh we also see a lot of uh you know tailwinds uh i'm sorry with the tailwind that a lot of these kind of structural costs come out with some of some of the headwinds but you know as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get the at incremental margin obviously to be at a minimum of that days or more okay your next school question comes from john walsh from credit suites your line is open sorry your next question is from marcus admire from ubs your line is open yeah hi good morning everybody uh i just want one more on the uh on this high high good morning uh on on synergies i i do appreciate that obviously procurement is uh volume dependent but um if like you attend to twenty million savings realize in twenty twenty um what do you currently assume a sort of full run rate savings house that waste one of the spend which i think is is a third of your overall spend and how should we think about more medium term for the other two thirds if you assume that at some point in a normalized way to get back to the twenty nineteen levels let's start here yeah i think if you think about it uh ten to twenty you know coming in uh in in in this year as you go into twenty twenty one assuming maybe kind of current volume levels uh it'll be twenty to forty million uh so that's maybe at least uh that what you can see here coming from wave one on a on an analyze level that current volumes and that only it's only over in you know a portion of the total spend with uh weights too on weight three coming up here in the second half of the year right and if the sort of an estimate you can give us what that would've been at nineteen volume levels that sort of you know twenty to four i mean it would definitely be a little bit higher than that i mean uh i i i wouldn't you know i think i think at this point in time you could say you know forty to fifty could be uh upwards of sixty okay okay and then and then second question on on capital allocation you flagged in the slides with with interesting that was both done in pst um it's obviously pretty fragmented market you probably have a share of called sixteen percent in that space um how do you how do you think about this how does that segment look like in a few years i mean it it's you know from an aftermarket perspective i know to design women replacement business so did the aftermarket dollars per se or share it's relatively small compared to openly average but but but how do you think about this sort of uh it just struck me that it was it was like specifically in the slides yeah i mean i think i think this is a segment we like a lot by the by the way that uh the businesses are kind of so the know niche and and very very solid uh market positions um and and he has just a lot of great uh uh descriptors such as you know kind of high growth margins and and and very specialized bonds that uh that are kind of really only mission critical uh in the in the in the processes where they where they apply uh you know we we continue to see that there's a lot of potential not only in organic but also organically uh and we're doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like uh the aero and combine that with the uh with the uh like a uh either a hasco-branded product or a milton roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness uh in terms of applications and then enter some new markets and that's what what a lot of the team are doing it's you know how do we uh are being thoughtful and mindful on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in and not only do that organically but then see what other technologies from a both a perspective we can we can acquire so a lot of a lot of really great work strategically going on on this segment uh to really uh picture this on how do we kind of do it thanks a lot good luck thank you your next question comes from john walsh from credit suites your line is open hi uh good morning sorry about that had some technical difficulties earlier i'm glad to hear everyone's doing well um you know maybe just one question here uh you alluded on the call to to share gains on kind of both the legacy gdi and ir businesses um i wanna know if you could put a little more color around what's driving those is it something on the product side is it you know some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around you know more niche markets like paper and pulp um maybe some competitive pressure is from smaller guys just any kind of color you could provide there would be helpful sure johnny so and and and category i mean what i what i said on the call is that it is on specific horse powers and and what we saw that we liked is that this is in the us based the third party uh report and and and and we liked because it was very very complementary so if you look at the legacy garner denver uh we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower uh while we saw on the ingresel brand some share take on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors i will categorize that as you know <unk> has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower uh well as you know you know from a gardner denver perspective we have been more focused on the medium to small compressor and and and i think you know this is uh what i mentioned on the call that this is the great hypothesis that we had on this great merch uh and and combining the two companies because now we have great new complimentary products and spectrum of technologies that uh that you know a lot of these that i mentioned is on the oil lubricated uh which is very good solid uh kind of core product line but as we spoke about during the april call now also the oil free product line spectrum so so again it's it's it's it's new technology new products and and be able to uh to to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the product that the teams are launching great i appreciate taking a question thank you there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back over to the company thank you i just want to close out by saying uh thanks to everyone for for your interest in uh <unk> i want to do another shootout and thank you to our employees that are uh always doing a lot of work here uh to stay health uh stay health to safety uh and uh and at the same time you know provide to our customers emission critical pros that that that are needed uh in this kind of current market condition so hopefully everyone stays safe and uh and healthy and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call thank you for participating you may now disconnect
