brief overview of our third quarter results followed by an update on the progress we've made on our monroe forward strategy as illustrated on slide three we were reported comps down point nine percent in the third quarter as higher year over year ticket was offset by negative traffic in october and the beginning of november we performed well against difficult comparisons in the prior year mild other conditions towards the end of november and in december caused the slowdown across our core northern markets these conditions have continued into january with our comparable store sales down four percent during the month we don't know talking about the weather however it is impossible to ignore the impact it has on our business while we are not satisfied with our financial results this quarter we are executing well against the areas within our control in particular we continue to move deeper into our company transformation and our confident we are on the right path we are committed to making the necessary changes across our organization to position us to deliver strong results no matter the external circumstances moving on to our performance by category in the third quarter we were down one percent year over year and entire comparable store sales as higher ticket year over year was offset by a decline entire volume we experience more normalized retail pricing this quarter and are focused on further refining our tire strategy to drive strength in our largest category importantly we are on track to roll out our tire category management in pricing system beginning in the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one which will enable a more dynamic and sophisticated approach to real-time pricing all provide more details on there shortly turning to our service and repair categories we saw a three percent decline in breaks year over year falling short of a difficult comparison in the third quarter last year in maintenance we were flat while front end shocks were down one percent and alignments decline three percent year over year overall our southern markets outperformed our northern markets as expected given the mild winter weather conditions we faced in this region new stores added twenty two point seven million in revenue during the quarter including twenty point seven million from recent acquisitions regarding our gross margin performance during the quarter we still have a client of twenty basis points compared to the prior year period primarily driven by the decrease in our comparable store sales which resulted in higher fixed cost as a percentage of sales our variable margin on the other hand expanded due to lower year over year material cost as a percentage of sales while slightly higher than the prior year quarter technician labor as a percentage of sales decrease sequentially for and last quarter this is a good example of us executing well against the areas within our control we identified issues last quarter that arose from our transformation and took corrective action to drive improve results we will have additional opportunities to get continue to improve results in this area as we implement our cloud-based store staffing and scheduling model towards the end of this fiscal year which would be critical for us to seamlessly adjust the changes in demand demand dynamics without sacrifice and sales i'd now like to turn to the progress we've made in our monroe forward strategy beginning with our store rebrand and reimage initiative on slide four this initiative focuses on creating a more consistent store appearance while also implementing standardized in store operating procedures which we call our monroe playbook additionally we are rebranding select stores to entire oriented banner where targeted demographics favor this type of store format in order to increase tire sales without sacrificing service revenues during the first half of fiscal twenty twenty we finalize the transformations of our first group of stores which includes forty four locations in rochester new york and a mid atlantic as well as the second group which includes forty three stores in our southern markets during the third quarter we continue to scale this initiative across our base and move forward with the transformation of seventy four stores and four markets and forty two of our recently acquired california stores we have completed the transformation in the seventy four stores and is substantially completed our california stores which are being rebranded under our tire choice auto service centers banner to higher awareness for tires turning to slide five i'd like to provide some additional context regarding our strategic rationale as we transform our store base as many of you know we operate in two store formats our serve brand stores which generate approximately six hundred thousand dollars per store and annualized sales and our tire brand stores which generate approximately one point two million per store and annualized sales prior to any rebrand activity we operated five hundred fifty five service brand stores and seven hundred thirty four tire brand stores and as we work to create a nationwide chain of consistently operated stores we are prioritizing the higher volume tire brands throughout this process we will be cons elevating our regional brands focusing on shipping our service brands over the tire brands the lower number of brands will also allow us to improve our marketing productivity when we speak to reimaging stores this primarily means modern i in the appearance of our stores with no associated brand change as we are making decisions regarding rebranding versus reimaging stores we are leveraging our analytical model as well as taken into account our brand equity in that market looking at the bottom left of the slide you can see here the progress we have made so far we are very much in the early innings of this transformation with two hundred three stores substantially completed out of our portfolio we separate these stores out between kind stores and non-comp stores which helps us to evaluate their performance post-free fresh of our approximately nine hundred comp stores that we set out to transform we've completed one hundred thirty four stores and have our approximately on and fifty non-comp stores we substantially completed sixty nine as we move forward with expanding this program across our base we will continue to prioritize markets that we expect will drive the largest benefit to our sales performance and our approach we measured in order to keep sales disruption to a minimum through the end of this fiscal year we are focusing on finalizing the transformation of our recently acquired california stores while starting the transformation of approximately eighty more stores that will be completed in q1 of fy twenty one moving onto the performance of the stores we've completed so far to help provide some additional granularity we separated out how rebrand stores have performed versus the stores that have just and reimaged importantly this data only includes comp stores have had a full quarter of performance following the completion of their transformation this is how we will speak to this performance excuse me of our transform stores moving forward as you can see and in line with our expectations we see a significant sales lift when we rebrand stores this ship optimizes our brand awareness and increases our tire sale without sacrificing our service revenues the stores that have been reinvented were slightly down as these are located in our northern markets which were impacted by the mild weather conditions i mentioned earlier we believe this before it's clearly highlights the strong opportunity we have and the benefits to come with a streamlined brand portfolio the seventy four stores that we recently completed and are not included in this calculation given they have not had a full quarter post transform issue yet but we are still we are seeing early signs of strength to these stores and are pleased with results while we still have a while to go to roll this program out to our entire base the sustained performance we've seen at the stores that have completed the transformation to date underscores the impact of this important initiative turning to slide six and the remainder of government road forward initiatives i'd like to focus my discussion on the initiatives that are top priority which we believe will be critical to supporting our broader strategy in a third order we began modernizing our store it infrastructure at all of our approximately thirteen hundred locations this new infrastructure enables state of the art technology including our new digital phone and texting system which is a major step towards improving the overall customer experience the system will allow us to better track customer execution driving a more consistent phone strategy and improve conversion our story infrastructure modernization will be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal twenty twenty one allowing us to leverage our new phone system which will be critical to driving traffic to our stores and the priority for us is the optimization of our entire category management we are on track and by the end of this fiscal year we expect our new pricing software will be operational we believe this will be critical to driving long term margin expansion by providing improved visibility into demand dynamics allowing us to better refine our assortment and execute our strategy become the number one destination for tires at any price point finally we are right on track to roll out a cloud base for a scheduling model pilot by year end gaining real time visibility into our labor model via the cloud will help us be more effective and strategic ensuring we are not understaffed and losing sales or overstaff when there is a lack of demand regarding our other teammate initiatives we have rolled out the monroe university program to all of our teammates in our continue to expand and enhance the course content we've also implemented mandatory on board training to ensure that everyone who joins our team is trained on our monroe playbook operating procedures in order to provide a quality five-star experience to our customers moving on to slide seven while we are very focused on the rollout of monroe forward acquisition to remain a cornerstone of our growth strategy during the quarter we closed the previously announced acquisitions of three companies one with fourteen locations in las vegas nevada and four in boise idaho as well as two companies that include nine stores in northern cal formula further solidify in our growing position in the western united states our presence in this region allows us to better service national accounts as well as benefit from the high concentration of vehicles in this market and the potential long term consumer shift to ride sharing the acquisition in nevada and ido which our new states to monroe is expected to add approximately twenty million in annualized sales represented sales mix of seventy five percent service and twenty five percent tires the acquisitions in california are expected to add approximately twenty five million in annualized sales representative sales mix of fifty five percent service and forty five percent tires these acquisitions are expected to be deluded to del earnings per share in fiscal twenty twenty overall acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal twenty twenty collectively represent and expected a hundred twenty million in annualized sales we operate in a very fragmented industry with significant opportunities for further consolidation and we believe we are well positioned to continue to execute on our robust pipeline of attractive m and a targets we currently have over ten nda signed with opportunities range from five to forty stores which we believe will allow us to maintain our leadership position in the markets we serve while continuing to expand our geographic footprint into attractive and underserved regions further by continuing to execute our row forward initiatives including our new brand standards and operating procedures we expect to integrate our new acquisitions more effectively and efficiently lastly we open one greenfield location during third quarter bringing our two little greenfield store openings to seven in fiscal twenty twenty in conclusion we are confident we are on the right track to drive future success in our business we are in the early innings of a significant company transformation that will result in a platform capable of delivering sustainable long-term growth we are not there yet in order we expect our results to be linear as we move through the transformation but we are committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business make the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control i'd like to thank the entire team at monroe for their exceptional work as we execute this strategy as well as our customers and shareholders for their con need support with that i'll turn the call over to our executive vice president chief financial officer and treasurer brian <unk> who will provide additional detail on our third quarter financial performance and fiscal twenty twenty outlook thank you brett good morning everyone turning to slide eight in our performance during the quarter sales increase six point two percent year over year to three hundred and twenty nine point three million driven by sales from new stores of twenty two point seven million including twenty point seven million from recent acquisitions partially offset by a decrease in sales from closed stores of approximately point eight million same store sales in the quarter were down point nine percent year over year the third quarter of fiscal two thousand twenty had eighty nine selling days in line with the previous year period rose margins decreased twenty basis points to thirty seven point eight percent in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand twenty from thirty percent in the prior year period this decrease was partially due to an increase in distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales as we lost leverage on these largely fixed costs with lower comparable store sales however as brett we saw improvements in our variable margin driven by lower material costs as a percentage of sales operating expenses for the quarter increased five point five million to ninety two point eight million or twenty eight point two percent of sale as compared with eighty seven point three million or twenty eight point one percent of sales for the prior year period the year over year dollar increase includes expenses from one hundred and three net new stores our operating income for the third quarter was thirty one point six million which increased by two point eight percent is compared to operating income of thirty point seven million for the same quarter last year and decreased as a percentage of sales from nine point nine percent to nine point six percent not interest expense for the third quarter increased point two million to seven million as compared to six point eight million in the same period last year the weighted average debt outstanding for the third quarter of fiscal two thousand twenty increased by approximately one hundred and twelve million is compared to the prior year period the increase is primarily related to an increase in financing lease that recorded in connection with our fiscal two thousand acquisitions and greenfield expansion as well as an increase in debt outstanding under our revolving credit facility to fund the purchase of our acquisitions the weighted average interest rate for the third quarter decreased by approximately one hundred forty basis point two over year due to lower libor and prime interest rates as well as lower borrowing rates associated with new leases our effective tax rate was twenty four point one percent for the third quarter compared to fifteen point three percent for the same period last year the year over year increase is primarily due to a one-time income tax benefit adjustment we realized in the prior year related to a retroactive accounting method change which was related to certain deductions that the irs had during the examination of our fiscal two thousand sixteen and fiscal two thousand seventeen tax returns net income for the third quarter was eighteen point nine million compared to twenty five million in the prior year period diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of fiscal two thousand twenty were fifty six cents compared to diluted earnings per share of sixty one cents in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand nineteen adjusted diluted earnings per share which is a non-cap for the third quarter of fiscal two thousand twenty with sixty cents which excludes from diluted earnings per share three cents of costs related to monroe four initiatives and one cent of costs related to acquisition due diligence and integration this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of fifty seven cents in the third quarter of fiscal two thousand nineteen which included one cent of costs related to monroe forward initiatives one cent of non-recurring corporate and field management realignment cost to six cents benefit from the one-time income tax adjustment for more information on this non-gat measure please see the reconciliation of adjusted diluted earnings per share to diluted earnings per share in our earnings release lastly we all open one greenfield location during the third quarter as a reminder greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operation greenfield locations on average are expected to add approximately one million each and annual sales as of december twenty eighth two thousand nineteen the company had one thousand two hundred eighty nine company operated stores and ninety nine franchise location as compared with one thousand one hundred and eighty six company operated stores a ninety nine franchise locations as of december twenty nine two thousand eighteen during the third quarter we had a twenty seven company operated stores and close none turning to slide nine we continue to maintain our disciplined approach to capital allocation as we execute our growth strategy our capital expenditures were forty two point two million in the first nine months of fiscal two thousand twenty of which approximately eighteen million was related to investments in our monroe forward initiatives we are pleased with the progress of our monroe forward strategy and we continue to expect an incremental seventy five million in capital expenditures above our normal run rate over five years to support investments story image and technology additionally a creative acquisition support our growth strategy during the first nine months of the year we spent approximately one hundred and four million on acquisitions including one to four store acquisitions completed as part of our greenfield expansion strategy as brett mentioned acquisitions announced in completed in fiscal two thousand twenty collectively represent and expected one hundred twenty million in annualized set i'd like to provide some additional clarity here the one hundred twenty million in sales represents the expected run rate for these stores once they have been fully integrated which as we've stated in the past is usually in year three post acquisition during years one and two following the acquisition we typically see a step down in sales given the process of onboarding new stores to our model moving on we continue to be committed to returning capital to our shareholders through our dividend program and paid approximately twenty two million in dividends in the first nine months of fiscal two thousand twenty finally we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet with ample flexibility to support our strategic growth initiative we entered the third quarter with strong leverage ratios and have ample room under our financial covenants we generated approximately one hundred twenty five million of cash flow from operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal two thousand twenty and debt under our revolving credit facility in raised by approximately fifty nine million dollars now turning to our outlook for fiscal two thousand twenty on slide ten we have updated our fiscal two thousand twenty comparable store sales guidance range to a decrease of one percent to flat to reflect the impact of our year today performance based on the updated comparable store sales guidance and the contribution from recently closed acquisitions we now anticipate fiscal two thousand twenty sales to be in the range of one billion two hundred seventy five million to one billion two hundred ninety million an increase of six point two percent to seven point five percent as compared to fiscal two thousand nineteen sales this compares to the previous sales guidance range of one billion two hundred nine eighty five million dollars to one billion three hundred and fifteen million dollars our guidance assumes relatively stable overall tire and oil costs for the balance of fiscal two thousand twenty given the impact of our year today performance we expect fiscal two thousand twenty earnings per diluted chair to be in the range of two dollars and twenty five cents to two dollars and thirty five cents representing a decline of five point one percent to point eight percent year over year compared to two dollars and thirty seven cents in fit twelve two thousand nineteen this compares to the previous guidance of two dollars and forty five cents to two dollars and fifty five cents on an adjusted basis which is a non gap measure the company expects diluted earnings per share to be in the range of two dollar and thirty five cents to two dollars and forty five cents representing a decline of one point seven percent to growth of two point five percent which excludes from diluted earnings per share monroe ford initiative costs and acquisition due diligence and integration for cost this compares to adjusted diluted earnings per share of two dollars and thirty nine cents in fiscal two thousand nineteen which excluded monroe ford initiative costs non-recurring corporate and field management realignment costs acquisition due dill gents and interpretation costs and the benefit from the one time in contacts adjustment acquisitions announced and completed in fiscal two thousand twenty are expected to be deluded to earnings per diluted chair during the year at the mid point of erga range we expect an operating margin of approximately ten point two percent interest expense to be approximately twenty nine million dollars appreciation and amortization to be approximately sixty five million and ebitda to be approximately one hundred ninety six million dollars we expect capital expenditures to be approximately sixty million this year this guidance reflects an effective tax rate of approximately twenty three point five percent and is based on thirty four million diluted weighted average shares outstanding and as always our guidance does not assume any future acquisitions or greenfield store openings i'll now turn the call over to broad to provide some closing remarks before we move to q and a thanks brian we are making solid strides in the execution of our monroe forward to energy in particular our store rebrand and re-image initiative the strong results of the locations that have completed this transformation underscore our confidence in this initiative the store rebrand and re-image program is further supported by our technological invest which we believe will help drive longterm margin expansion in summary we remain committed to driving the necessary changes to improve our business making the appropriate course corrections when necessary and executing well against the areas within our control we are excited for our future and look forward to capitalizing on the attractive opportunities ahead with that i will now turn the call over to the operator for questions thank you at this time we will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before press from the star keys once again that is star one to register questions at this time our first question is coming from brian nagle of <unk> please go ahead good morning brian so i wanna focus i apologize for uh uh focusing on the weather here but i i do i do just want to dive a little deeper into uh sales trends in the quarter so brian you mentioned i think brian did you did too and you're prepared comments just you made some comment you know commentary secure stand that you know to the degree to which weather impacted the business i was wondering if you can roll down a little further and say you know what that negative point nine comp you know would've been had the weather cooperated and some of the other the other metrics you're seeing that really seek as the underlying business is is trending better than what we saw uh in the in the weather affected uh physical q3 yeah i'll i'll take the first part and i'll let brian take the second part of the question brian uh when we look at the performance and the as we talked about our northern markets certainly underform the southern markets and give you a little more granularity on that uh certainly our stores up in the northeast um and the midwest were where you would expect to have more expect that's that's that's what i like to have in the northeast certainly underperform i think it's difficult to say what we would have done um you know certainly i think we were expecting you know positive comps in the quarter uh our internal uh expectations would've been closer to plus one plus one and a half uh assuming normalized weather conditions that we have seen in the past uh we felt really good coming out of october november given the strength of last years performing that we were coming against and and didn't get the cooperation from the weather in december that we were certainly expecting uh as i made the comments in my prepared remarks we certainly don't like talking about the weather that's fine but we can't ignore the fact that when fifty percent of our business is tires and we have a high concentration of stores in the northeast and midwest we are gonna have outsized exposure to our our account performance okay brian would you mind uh maybe take a restate in the second part of your question well i think i look i i think you covered right maybe i'll just bounce it in a follow-up question if i if i could so the guide the adjusted guidance then you mentioned the so in january you were did uh i think a negative four now if i'm doing the math it looks as though the adjusted guidance would suggest some type of pickup then in business in in february march i guess the first question is is that assumption correct in then the following question is you know and i know we've seen this before with your business but you know at what point does conclude we still have a long we have potentially a long time in the winter the weather could still come but is there a point at which in in in the quarter where the whether this comes too late yeah so so brian your assumption is correct um regarding the uh regarding the implied comps so if you think about q4 at the midpoint uh of let's say a down point five for the full year down point five that implies q4 of down two which would uh be about february march being down one in order to get to that down two so that that's the dynamic at the mid point so there is an expectation of a of a pickup in february and march and and brian maybe just a comment on the second part um you know as we get deeper into the fourth quarter our fourth quarter the second half of the quarter in particular i think we've become less sensitive to the weather as you transition out of the pure winter conditions into uh spring um certainly i think you know the later in the quarter you get snowfall certainly doesn't have the same impact on tired demand like you would find in our business if we got snowfall in october or november uh consumers are pretty uh thrifty with their money and i believe you get snow fall late in the season they have a tendency to forgo that purchase and push it out till next season in particular the other thing to call out uh as well is if you look at our historic performance at the company uh december and january have always been the most volatable volatile months that we've had contend with and i think uh what we've seen in fast performance here um friends coming out of december january don't necessarily reflect what you see in the spring uh month so um given the the mild december january heading into the balance of the quarter we feel pretty good about the guidance range we provided as brian said our midpoint assumes that on the low end of our comp sales guidance that assumes run rate coming out of january which we certainly believe we're gonna be better than that as we roll into sy twenty one all right i appreciate all the color thank you thanks brian thank you our next question is coming from jonathan limers of bmo capital markets please go ahead thanks um brett looking at your slide on the store rebranding uh you know the eighteen percent performance of the rebranded stores um i think is good uh i'm i'm curious from your analytics model how many years should it take a rebranded store to reach projected run rate sales well if you look at look at the top quadrant about slide johnson we've shared you know with investors the fact that our service stores do roughly six hundred thousand dollars in revenue and our tire stores do a million two so in the case where we're rebranding a service store you're you're working off a base on average of six hundred thousand and if we've seen i'll call it double digit improvement off of that base you can get to implied numbers certainly on how fast or how long it would take to ramp to the full maturity equally average sales performance of our tire brand of stores and that's one of the things that's encouraging about the strategy for us so it's not that it's just a one time step up in sales this creates the opportunity to create multiple gears of uh sustainable growth as our brand and our positioning uh our brand related to tires starts to mature uh keep mind the tire purchase cycle with consumers is anywhere from two to four years so if we rebrand right before a consumer made that decision to buy tires uh we won't be relevant necessarily to that consumer for two to three years out so so to put that on a timeline that you're looking at three to five years to certainly mature out to average sales per with the tire branding store okay so just to circle up on that for the stores where you're rebranding there's nothing about their markets um like you you would expect that those stores would have sales comparable to your existing tire brand stores of the one point two million is that correct yeah as a general statement that's correct i think certainly you're gonna have markets that will exceed the average and you'll have some markets that will be lower than that and that's part of the choices that we that we make using the analytic model but but on average as we look across our i'll say the opportunity stores that be in the five fifty five i think we feel very be comfortable on average that we can reach the full potential of the one point two over time as they mature thanks uh switching gears brian how much of a headwind um to that uh we revenue from acquisition were the conversions of the forty two california stores this quarter yeah i mean we we had uh you know some disruption there um i would say you know uh we haven't really quantified that um from a from a sales standpoint but you know that's a great point jonathan in that we have immediately put the new stores that we acquire on the monroe playbook uh and then shortly thereafter in this case about six months uh get the the re-image uh in store brand standards in place uh so those the in q3 uh the forty two california stores went through that um and are substantially through that uh as of the end of q3 um but we're we haven't quantified it but it certainly had some impact on their sales performance in the quarter okay and that one point eight million charged from in row ford initiative uh this quarter what was that four yes it was all related to the store rebrand and re image um and it falls into three primary buckets uh related to that uh the first is non-capital uh items that we send to the stores so as we think about uh updated uh safety chains updated bay banners updated point of sale marketing materials all of these things to get the store initially to uh the standard uh that are not capital uh in terms of the actual uh work and construction done on the store that's the first bucket uh the second bucket is non-capital work that's actually done we get into these stores and we add that uh non-capital repairs uh demolition uh as well as um some of the fixed verse replace items for example stripping a floor and redoing a floor versus installing a new floor those are things that uh make sense economically but you get different treatment from expense versus capital four so that's the second bucket and the third is just right off of existing lease holds in the stores uh anything from counters to uh maybe some existing signage that was put up as part of an acquisition when we initially branded the stores over to a monroe brand um those are the three primary buckets that uh that uh the monroe forward initiative cost uh consist of okay thanks for coming thank you excuse me our next question is coming from brett jordan of jeffrey's please go ahead hey good morning guys good morning what about hey i'm back to slide five i guess if we look at the eighteen percent growth and rebranded stores if we really sort of look at the comparable growth there you know x the new product lines you're adding how's the service comp against the service comp in those stores are you seeing you know pick up as you change the brand yeah maybe just to clarify though brad i think uh we're actually not adding any new products to the service menu right right but you're adding fire to the store right yeah it's just mixed right so we've even our service stores they sell tire it's only fifteen percent of their mix so we're certainly seeing growth more outsized growth in their tire sales and we've had success in maintaining the rate of growth that we've seen on the service side which has been part our thesis is uh hold on uh to the service business that we'd enjoy that's high margin uh and then add to that more relevancy to the marketplace on tires and drive the growth through the the tire category we're seeing like on on both sides okay and i guess we look at the re-image how does that compare to you know comparable service stores in the network that hadn't been re-imaged i guess sort of looking at it again sort of apples to apples you know against the old stores yeah i think if uh if you can figure out which stores we're talking about there the thirty stores are rochester and i think yeah the rochester stores certainly if they have been performing quite well uh relative to what our expectations were on re-image we certainly didn't expect to see double digit growth rates out of a re-image store and we set out to do this initiative uh but we were seeing a more positive growth out of the stores up until the last quarter uh given the exposure that we've had to uh the weather in the north fucking bear to other stores uh we're still pleased with what we're seeing from a customer service point of view and from a comp sale point of view relative to their peers uh facing similar i would say market backdrop from a weather point of view okay could you give us i guess sort of the the the the spread between the southern store copy and the northern store copy you know how they get delta was it i mean it was it was uh a couple hundred basis points that perform okay and i guess for housekeeping could you give us the monthly uh yeah so uh we were uh one second here uh we were down uh one point two in october down one point seven in november and i'll point four in december okay and then one just this is sorry add the questions on the supply chain side i mean just to throw the virus into it since that's popular these days you guys do a lot of direct sourcing um you know the the white box product at a china do you see any impact on supply chain from what's going on uh we haven't seen any uh to this point prep uh we're obviously working through contingency plans which we have i've had to develop actually related to the the tariff uh issues so we feel pretty confident that through the network of you know multiple supply points that we'll be able to uh overcome any particular issues coming from the virus let me get my first virus yeah i'm sorry bret go ahead i said no i'm joking so i had to get my first virus question in there yeah all right thanks a lot guys okay thank you our next question is coming from rick nelson of students please go ahead uh thanks good morning like two more follow up on the weather uh last year i think december january you also pointed to mild winter weather do you think this year was incrementally worse than the prior year i think if you look at uh you know analysts before so we've seen uh talking about i guess the impact that the mild winner has had on not only our category but i think other retail like the data would indicate that this has been more mild uh certainly versus last year and i think we look at precipitation which is very important for us the form of snow with our entire business certainly it's been a much more mild winter this year relative to last year okay okay and brett uh any updates on your partnership with amazon uh what you're seeing there on the install side and how you think your tire uh price is uh compared to theirs and and the entire category overall i'm curious about uh what happened with units in the period and uh market share yep so um let's start with units our units were down to uh average showing price was up uh one uh for the for the uh for the quarter uh how that compares we don't have a lot of you know syndicated data course that we can look to and be definitive on that we've leaned on i guess our channel checks and information from our tire manufacturers that have good visibility across multiple brands and it feels like similar to other companies that have exposure to the north and particular northeast which is a degree that we do we feel like we are probably in line with what we picked up through suppliers and and others um as it relates to amazon i think we're still a yeah please with our relationship with them as well as other online tiger retailers uh we uh we will eventually expand the relationship in fy twenty one to include all stores we talked about last core or priority has been uh what i mentioned on today's call uh completing the tire category management pricing tool as well as the labor scheduling tool that are just for our organization i think higher priority at this stage than expanding uh but we are committed to expanding that relationship going forward uh related to tire pricing uh as you know rick the entire category is very complicated you know over thirty thousand skews that uh that you need to manage effectively across multiple markets and one of the reasons why we've invested in the entire category management tool is to do a couple of things one is give us much better visibility into demand dynamics to find by elasticity down to a skew level and by having that visibility it's gonna create a much more granular approach that we're gonna use for pricing uh it allow us to price at the school level uh in our industry uh with the intent theme strike that right balance between the driving the right price to drive unit volume while preserving and expanding our entire margins through uh right mix at right price uh i'm encouraged we're in pilot form of that now uh we will be out operational by q1 of next year uh fully operational uh the roll out of that's pretty small and scale cause we control our pricing centrally so a small team of people will be trained up on using that system but between now and q1 will be testing and for well that makes it more confident with uh the results that we're seeing from the system that uh that makes sense uh thanks for the color and good luck thanks greg thank you once again ladies and gentlemen if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question is coming from stephanie benjamin of suntrust robinson unfree please go ahead hi good morning thank you for the question morning um i wanted to go back i know in the prior quarters when you started rolling out some of these story refreshes you've called out a hits or headwind to comps during that quarter really just from distraction you know it makes sense as you're in there kind of reworking and revamping this doors i believe you said it was about a seven space that you wanted to hit last quarter did you quantify that this quarter or is there a way for you to kind of break that out or just whether um overshadow that yeah i think we said last quarter uh some for me that we we walked everyone kind of through the the seven step process and and talked about how we were retooling it to take take um a lot of that work or almost all that work off of the store teams so we were able to effectively that in in q3 we didn't expect that we were gonna have to talk about a headwind uh and we really don't have to in terms of from disruption related to the store we image um i think i think the the california stores on the west coast uh maybe saw a little bit more in disruption just because we did put a little bit more on them based on their proximity you know lack of proximity to our our core resources that are doing the image but for the seventy four comp stores those were largely uh i would say undisrupt great and then just as a followup when we look at the tire category in general what are you seeing from this over an inflationary environment i know it was inflationary earlier this year um kind of reviewing how you thought your the quarter and the expectations going forward as well uh yes stephanie when you look at uh if we go back to q2 one of the things we commented on was just we saw some inflationary pricing on i was with the top end of the product category with more premium brands uh and the first part of the the second quarter we didn't see a lot of movement on the the low end brands if you will opening price point brands we saw that change exiting future you and into q3 and i think as you saw we made the comments in our prepared remarks uh we certainly feel better about pricing moving up across uh all all price points uh relative to that point in q three i think our expectation for the q4 is pretty stable environment uh around pricing uh we don't expect you know meaningful material changes uh in the next quarter uh you know i think we're we're very focused now on are now optimizing you know our internal pricing relative to the market leveraging you know the category management pricing tool we talked about great and then just lastly for me a more high level as you know we think through this strategy to expand your your tire services at some of those the mix changes at your service stores does that just by nature put you a little bit more successful to changes in weather on an annual basis you know to your point set on this call that you know it is the tire category that we're if it's a more mild weather or where you don't really see the the volume during that period so does this mean that you know in these conversations going forward whether it could have a larger impact just similar to what we saw this year that maybe in prior year so maybe your thoughts on that just high level would be great thanks so much yeah thanks stephanie i think you know strategically um i would i would start with this they are strategy of neuros we like the business model at our stores that has a very focused menu that's focused on tires and full service um i think you're not gonna see us migrate to a tire only category as a broad sweeping strategy for all the reasons you just mentioned uh we like to versification in the services uh we like uh being very relevant on frequently purchase items uh like scheduled maintenance for cars and and certainly breaks in other under car services um i think as we increase our to business uh certainly we were gonna pick up a little more exposure to tires as we convert more stores in the north uh i think to that however i think our broader company strategy is diversify our store footprint more into the south and out west and certainly in those regions of the country you don't see i think the level of volatility that comes with a tire business like you would find in the northeast and midwestern markets great that's everything for me i appreciate it okay thanksgiving thank you our next question is coming from scott september of seal king please go ahead uh good morning and thanks for taking my questions where's scott uh following up on that last question about um you know high level about weather and i know the goal here was with all this heavy lifting that you're doing right now on all these product diseases get to the point where i guess we're not talking about whether having a work weather does not really derail the quarter from a comp perspective could you talk about i mean just broadly speaking about how long do you think that will take for us to get to that point where whether it could be a headwind but it's not going to be a determined whether you're positive negative from a content standpoint yeah i think given our our exposure to the northeast the as long as our store concentration is heavy in the midwest and northeast and hearing in that as we pick up exposure i think to to weather uh obviously we don't like to talk about sky as you said our strategies to diversify the footprint uh keep continue to grow down south and that's reflected by our acquisitions we continue to build out florida and have expanded now into louisiana and in tennessee and certainly outlast is reflected of that desire to create more or less valid volatility in our business due to the store store footprint now in our core store markets uh we don't accept internally you know the volatility in our business and and we're we're investing in technology as we talked about to help us better execute in stores through better train people uh execute and better on the phones with our phone upgrade uh that we're currently doing all the initiatives underman row forward are designed to drive for full comments in our stores regardless of weather but i think we'll help neutralize some of the impact that we see from from the volatility that comes with uh snow and colder temperatures got it and just a last core um you know i know that there were certain things like higher just that we'll see in the media and impact from from weather but more on the side of mechanical parts typically you could see an impact from you know uh warmer weather or cold weather you know uh a few quarters down the road is there a chance that we could see an extended negative impact on the mechanical part side in the next couple of quarters and that's all i have thanks okay thanks guys i think uh commented in the quarter our breaks were down three percent in the quarter um certainly we're up against the strong comp from last year but also i would say we do sell a fair share of uh break services through tires cause as you take the consumers tires off the our vehicle gives you the chance to inspect uh their wheels their brakes and we do see some nice demand for conversion from tires into brakes as a result of that um it relates to the downstream effect uh i think uh so really more harsh winners of a tennessee to tear up things on the vehicles however i will say one benefit of having a more mild winner is usually that leads to spring coming sooner that opens up a window i think for an extended spring selling season so look we're we felt feel like we're well positioned i think coming out of the winter given our strength and how we performed historically in the service categories and given the emphasis to we placed on good better best packages in store i think we feel confident that we will uh we will be well positioned going into the spring selling season got it that's all i have thanks thanks got it okay thanks you at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest and support of monroe we believe we're well positioned to execute our strategy and drive long-term value for our shareholders look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter have a great day ladies and gentlemen thank you for your participation this concludes today's event you may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day yeah
