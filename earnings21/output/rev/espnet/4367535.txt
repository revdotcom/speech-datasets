good day and welcome to defend second quarter twenty twenty financial results in corporate update conference call at this time all participants are in listen only mode as a reminder today's conference is being recorded and <unk> institute you your host for today's conference alexander <unk> is head of investor relations at phone please go ahead thank you charlotte i'd like to welcome and thank you all for joining us today for athletes second quarter twenty twenty financial results in operational progress conference call before we begin i would like to encourage everyone to go to the investor relations section of athletes website to find the earnings release and related financial tables we also post that slides on our websites that follow our discussion today on the call today we are joined by doctors <unk> our chief executive officer andrea's heart stroke chief medical officer <unk> chief scientific officer and angus smith a new chief financial officer who joined us in july we're also joined by dr wolfgang fisher our chief operating officer and ms denise mueller chief business officer they will also be available for the q and a session before we start i will quickly go through

good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for our second quarter business update call today we have some updates to share with you on our operational progress as well as on our financial results while we're still in the middle of a serious global health pandemic and a challenging uh economic downturn uh and governments were quite confident that the steps were taking in at advancing our science and moving our pipeline forward are beginning to yield data that demonstrate the longterm potential of our innovative approaches and products covid nineteen continues to affect the scientists around in the world and we hope that you and your families are uh well and safe uh we are observing some impact by covid nineteen on the progress of our clinical studies however is that last time we're taking great efforts to minimize them as a result we have been able to continue our progress on the clinical studies of a m thirteen in the referral t-cell lymphoma and of a m twenty four in each of our positive tumors and which is very exciting for us genetic dose the first patient with r o seven twenty nine seven oh nine uh which as you remember is the b c m a c d sixty eight and that's an engagement we are also making a progress on our preclinical pipeline for our lead candidate from thirteen our study in patients who have relapsed or refractory peripheral t cell lymphoma and exhausted available standard of care for events are now being treated with a from thirteen as a single agent we're executing according to our development timelines and as previously stated expect to complete the predetermined interim analysis in mid twenty twenty one um we're also looking at options to enhance a from thirteen efficacy beyond monotherapy the first of these options is the combination with <unk> in a study that is conduct it at the md anderson cancer institute and on i s t and the end of the website now shows that the study is enrolling but initiation is impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic in taxes at first and then the study is expected as soon as this situation improves for april twenty four we disclosed that we have completed the first cohort of our dose escalation study without any those limiting toxicities and we're apparently recruiting into the second dose court we have all four plan sites active and uh recruiting following the completion of the dose escalation uh phase of the study we have the option to enroll patients into tumor specific expansion cohorts where we will look for single agent activity in a number of files defined tumor times in addition we're planning to initiate combination studies with check point in the test and we will be providing updates as the program continues to make progress we're very pleased with a continued progress in our collaboration with genetic importantly the phase one clinic staff with a b c m a c d sixty eight in its engagement is now enrolling patients this achievements represents the third in it and engagement to enter the clinic and triggers a milestone payment to us during the third quarter in an amount that we're not able to disclose last month angus smith joined us as chief financial officer angus will introduce himself later and discuss our financial position and the flex it provides us to continue to execute on our strategy and try to future growth of our company during the annual general meeting of shareholders which was held in august four we're happy to report that all proposed the agenda items were approved this includes the addition of dr and alicia chankens and uh harry welcome to the supervisor report is new members an alicia is a visionary leader who knows how to translate sign from bench to bedside and harry is an accomplished financial executive who will help drive value creating strategies for the company these additions to the supervisory board further strength and the company's industry know how experience never as it is as it has only been a month and a half since we last spoke to you we thought we would focus today's discussion on company achievements thus far and what gives us confidence in our signs up thank you on our programs and allow plenty of time for q and a to get started i will now hand over the call to address <unk> to give you a brief update on our community stage programs address yeah thank you adi for the introduction and uh thank you all for joining us today and i'm happy to give you an update on the progress in our clinical programs uh that we made over the last uh three months as you are aware covid nineteen pandemic is still present globally and it continues to pose challenges for the conduct of clinical trials and the enrollment of patients uh the two guiding principles we are employing at afmat is to ensure patient safety owns the studies and to ensure trial data integrity and this is in line i think with uh guidances given from our competent authorities within this framework however the apmat team is very proactively working with all of our participating sites to make sure that our innovative treatment is still available for patients uh in the need of new therapeutics and that we uh minimize the impact of covid nineteen to a minimum possible one important achievement in this regard is that we were able to secure drug supply for all of our ongoing studies and can ensure uninterrupted treatment of all patients to go into more detail let's start with afm thirteen our most advanced programs first as you know afm thirteen is in a registration directed uh phase two study afm thirteen two oh two treating patients with relapsed and refractory a peripheral t-cell lymphoma we have exhausted all available standard of care options the enrollment into the study is at a steady state we were able to activate fifty four sites style contributing patients in ten countries around the globe as you know uh this is a the study has a simon two stage design with a pre-plant interim analysis after forty patients in the ptcl cohorts and as i said we are confident that we will have the data from this internal analysis available by the middle next year there was also a third cohort or there is a third cohort um in this study for patients with transformed nico's fungal eaters so a continuous form of t-cell lymphoma this third cohort with nico's fungal eaters was never part and never intended to be part of the registration program it was a proof of concept cohort only and for covid nineteen related restrictions the enrollment into this cohort is currently on hold as i also mentioned we are continuing to make progress in our collaboration with md anderson cancer center where we have an active i n d for our first uh phase one study of afm thirteen in combination with allogenic uh national killer cells uh as i said the current status at the md anderson wet page is recruiting and we know that uh patients are currently screened and considered and we are expecting to the enrollment of the first patient as soon as covid nineteen related restrictions at md anderson are lift up now let's move to our second program afm twenty four as you know by specific tetra available molecule targeting both cd sixteen eight to activate national killer cells and macrophages and the egf receptor on solid tumors as a compound is in the phase one those escalation part of the one oh one study and we are happy to report that we were able to activate all four pre-planned sites and all four pre-planned sites our country in patients as we disclosed earlier we have completed cohort one without observing those limiting toxicities and are actively recruiting into those cohort two with this i close the overview of the clinical progress and i'm happy to hand over to my colleague orange materials chief scientific officer who will review with you some of our preclinical data that make us so excited about the opportunities that we can create for patients with ics and activating the innate immune system aren't please thank you andres and thank you all for joining um in the next few minutes i would like to summarize as under i mentioned the pre-clinical and clinical data observed so far with our innate selling gators uh providing average that these molecules are potent and safe drug candidates i'll start by summarizing the data showing that our ics are potent molecules as you see on slide for i've if we take fm thirteen as an example fm thirteen has been shown strong single agent anti-tumor responses and t-cell lymphoma with a normal response rate of fifty percent it the molecule has also shown promising signs of broad clinical development potential in augmenting other io therapies such as pd one inhibitors for example in the hutchkin the former phase one these we've seen an impressive overall response rate of eighty eight percent with a complete response rate of forty two and forty six percent in the local and the central read respectively the and the low part of the slide we've also highlighted for you presentations of the studies past and in the future additionally our own experience and the work with md anderson we have seen promising pre-clinical data showing that the combination with the adoptive transfer of nk cells enhanced the immune response of even thirteen leading to prolonged survival in the risk active mouse model and as we mentioned the phase one b studied and anderson is now in the last stages of preparation if we go to slide six you see that in our pre-clinical study is with afm twenty four we saw potent killing of egfr positive tumors alliance mediated by two distinctive mechanisms of action potent adcc or antibody depend then seller side toxicity is seen irrespective of the mutational status of the tumor cells and we see potent killing mediated of by adcp or anybody dependent selling the fabric cytosis in tumor cells with high and low egfr expression importantly in cells bearing the kras g thirteen d mutation af and twenty four shows preserved killing the and killing or adcp or fiber cytosis whereas disability is lost for established treatments for the n t b c m a cd sixteen or r seven two nine formally loan as af and twenty six molecule we also have very good potency in center of monkeys whereas a dose dependent killing of bcma positive plasma cells um it was observed we believe that the observed improved potency is mediated by the dual motor action of our approach the nate cell engages employing nk cells and mcafee is to kill tumor cells and that's act via a two-pronged mode of action of antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity and antibody dependent cytosis to fight cancer in this dual motivation is differentiated from other innate cell targeted approaches as these specifically activate nk cells only rna cell engages work at low expression levels the potency is this independent of the surface target expression and you see this continuing slide six with even thirteen we learned that there is a broad range of cell lines that express different levels of tumor antigen and we have not observed any dependency of target expression to the potency of the molecule the same holds true for elton twenty four and the n t p cma engagement pre-clinically both molecules have shown high potency across a wide range of egfr n b cma surface expression including a low target expression holes this implies that more patients could respond to treatment within an hl engagement versus an antibody drug conjugate or adc as the mechanism of adcs at and shown only to rely on certain levels of target antigen thereby missing those tumor cells with expression levels below the ability of the adc to bind to target cells as we move on to slide seven and report on the safety front pre clinically our innate selling address demonstrate low cytokine release some examples of this are the i enabling toxicology study in cinema august monkeys which consistently showed no meaningful increases in serum cytokines for example at the june virtual acr conference a preclinical poster presentation on the r seven twenty nine molecule of genetic showed potent cell killing tumor cell lines employing nk cells as affect your cells with minimal increase in cytokines also a four week safety <unk> showed a favorable safety profile with no cytokine release or adverse findings at the fifteen one five and fifty so five zero mixed pick tested dose levels and in the case of eight and twenty four only a transient increase in l six was observed that was fully reversible within twenty four hours but no signs of cytokine release was observed that would lead want to believe that there is a risk of a cytokine storm in patients important to note here is that none of the clinical studies of af and thirteen have revealed any significant increases in serum cytokines these data indicate that r i c s have a tolerable and good safety profile taken all together these data suggests that our innate cell engages are potent able to engage at the over levels of antigen expression and have thus far demonstrated a good and tolerable safety profile now in order to maximize the opportunity for molecules in addition to clinical development as more of therapies we are also pursuing combinations with natural killer cells and other treatments such as checkpoint inhibitors such as pd one and pd one we go to slide eight and first let me comment on our common nation approach with nk cells as you see on the slide there is evidence showing that high nk cell numbers are associated with better outcomes for example patients with metastatic continuous melanoma have improved survival rates if their tumors show evidence of nk cell infiltration we also know that patients with diffuse large b cell and for lymphomas treated with andy cd twenty antibodies that have low peripheral nk counts tend to have poor survival we are seeing that one of the limitations in treating patients is that they don't have the appropriate amount of nk cells so we are working on supplementing nk cells through adoptive transfer and are currently assessing different approaches as you and see on slide nine as we go to slide ten and as discussed earlier the improved tumor kill cell killing by loading nk cells with our ics as you see on the for in detro data on the right hand side of slide ten that will be investigated in the md anderson phase one study in cd thirty positive recurrent or reflect your hodgkin and non-hodgkin lymphoma patients the pre-clinical data that we share here or have shared before leads us to believe that they can expect to see an improvement in the efficacy of an innate cell engagement a from thirteen through the addition of nk cells and encouraged by the synergistic potential of combining our ics with nk cells and checkpoint inhibitors we're currently evaluating the opportunity and our developing clinical plans for these combinations with afm twenty four uh finally let me just briefly summarize the recent posters presented at asr as a reminder of afm twenty four poster demonstrated its distinct mechanism of action different from other egfr signaling inhibition approaches potentially able to provide benefit to broad range of cancer patients and in the case of the joint poster with genetic the preclinical pharmacology and safety of the b c n a cd sixteen a in eight cell engagement shows potent cell killing and tumor cell lines employing in k cells as affect your cells minimal increase in cytokines suggesting a low risk of cytokine release syndrome we hope this background was helpful for you and i will now turn the call over to angles to introduce himself and provide an update on the financials thanks thank you art thank you art before i discuss before i discuss financial highlights highlights let me just say that i am thrilled that i'm going back and i look forward to that looking forward to working with our talent to deliver on our exciting sideline turning to the results for the quarter happy meds consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with i f r s have issued by the international accounting standard board for i a s b the consolidated financial statements are presented in euros which is the company's functional and presentation currency therefore often in numbers that i will present in this call unless otherwise noted will be in euros we ended the second quarter with cash cash equivalence and current financial assets of ninety two point six million euros compared to a hundred four point one million euros on december thirty first two thousand nineteen during the quarter we received net proceeds of approximately twenty point eight million euros under our at the market for atm program based on our current op rating plan and assumptions we anticipate that our cash cash equivalence and current financial assets will support operations into the first half of twenty twenty two net cash use in operating activities for the quarter ended june third yes twenty twenty which is fifteen million euros compared to five point six million euros in the second quarter of two thousand nineteen the second quarter two thousand nineteen net cash use and operating activities included a milestone payment to the company from virginia collaboration total revenue for the second quarter of twenty twenty two point nine million euros compared with four million euros in the second quarter of two thousand nineteen revenue in twenty twenty and twenty nineteen predominantly relates to the an intech collaboration revenue from the genentech collaboration in the second quarter twenty twenty was comprised that revenue recognized for collaborative research services performed performed during the quarter r d expenses for the second quarter of twenty twenty we're eleven point seven million euros compared to eleven point five million euros in the second quarter of two thousand nineteen expensive in twenty twenty relate predominantly to our afm thirteen and afm twenty four clinical programs as well as to our early stage development and discovery activities dna expenses for the second quarter of twenty twenty for two point six million euros compared to two point three million euros in the second quarter of two thousand nineteen the increase is primarily related to higher socks compliance costs legal consulting and audit costs net loss for the second quarter of twenty twenty was twelve point two million euros or sixteen cents per common share of ten point three million or seventeen cents per common share during the second quarter of two thousand nineteen the weighted number of commentary to outstanding for the quarter ended june thirtieth twenty twenty for seventy nine point two million i will now turn the call back to audi audi thank you angus um as you can see from our presentation today uh we're taking advantage of uh the knowledge that we've gained in the field of uh in immunity and are applying it to our uh programs going forward uh this experience in working with the innate immune system is uh something that we have uniquely established that uh afmat and is uh helping us in guiding the design of unique therapies which now have the potential to address very different kind of cancers i just wanna point out here that the egfr is expressed in more than ten tumors and that gives us a lot of optionality how to take this molecule forward we're pleased with how things are moving forward for both our clinical and preclinical programs especially in the current environment our curriculum programs are on track and it's from thirteen and twenty four are moving forward according to plan and china that is moving things forward with the anti b c m a c d sixty eight in its engagement what are our inflection points for the next one and a half years for even thirteen uh we've mentioned that um we want to present the interim data in peripheral t-cell lymphoma around uh middle of next year we've been uh successful in our collaboration with md under moving forward the combination of uh afm thirteen and uh corporate arrived uh natural killer cells uh as we said we're ready to start on the end of the news ready to start and we hope to report for a patient then and we will provide update as we move forward for a from twenty four in the midst of those escalation in order to generate safety and uh activity data uh this is quite exciting for us because it's a work with a very differentiated profile as profile as compared to the uh uh other more it is currently used in targeting egf receptor now with the dose escalation and establishing the safety uh we obviously will have the recommended phase to those uh coming up in order to then do the those cohort expansions but as we've mentioned earlier as well as planning early on to move forward into combinations uh we're very happy with the progress in the genentech uh collaboration uh just provided the next update for the pcma cb sixty eight engagement we have multiple other programs ongoing and if things go well pending on program protection we progression we can bring in additional milestone and the fire newest additions to the pipeline uh with uh a m twenty eight and a m thirty two uh we are starting the id enabling studies so that we can have an uh an id file in first for a m twenty eight finally before we open the session for q and a i would like to thank all our employees for their contribution and express our gratitude my gratitude in particular of our investigators and the clinic sites uh the patients and and all their families and our investors who are supporting us in our efforts to develop these innovative treatments for cancer patients it is through the combined efforts of all of you that keeps us on the paths of for discovery and innovation uh i'm now happy to close the presentation and uh we're open now for questions thank you please <unk> will now begin the question and answer session as a reminder should be refilled as a court you will need to press star on the number one in the telephone and wait for the name to be announced if you wish to answer it and press the pound or hash key once again it's star and one for a question first question comes from the line of mario <unk> from jeff free sweet to go ahead and hear my style open hi good morning everyone uh cause that's on the progress and thanks for taking my questions um to start off just wondering for f and twenty four um sure how much you can say on this but just wondering if both patients in core two have been dosed and um if you can talk more uh about the timing of dosing between patients with the four sites activated can you provide any more perspective about enrollment pace going forward andrea can you take the question please yeah so there were multiple parts of the questions i hope i got them all um so the phase one study of a m twenty four um as we said we are uh recruiting in the second cohort um we have not yet disclosed how many patients um as you know it's a standard uh three by 3d sign um voice was a beijing dose modification uh but that's basically what it is um in terms of timing between the patients uh there is a mandatory eight day waiting period uh between patients uh so they can be treated all at the same time but will be staggered with eight day intervals and there wasn't other part of the question around the four participating sites right yeah i just wonder if you can provide any more perspective about uh enrollment pace going forward yeah currently the enrollment uh pace is uh as pre-specified by the protocol also all sites are very active in screening patients and as we said all patients all sites have already contributed patients got it okay great and then also for af and twenty four um just checking if you can say more about the the two or types that you're screening for the study and if you can also provide more perspective into the checkpoint inhibitor and combo plans at this point um so for the uh tumor types um in the dose escalation part uh we are accepting all patients with all histologies uh that our egf are expressing and uh where the patient has exhausted the respectives standard of care treatments as i mentioned this is a wide variety of potential tumors uh probably the two most prevalent tumors would be colorectal cans i know small cell lung cancer and uh these are the two histologies where we would expect probably the majority of patients in the face one uh having said that uh the those escalation part would also be be open for other egf are expressing tumors uh like for example had a neck cancer gastric cancer or or other solid tumors now once we have defined our dose limiting toxicities or if there are no dose limiting toxicities we have defined recommend that phase two dose uh we will enroll into uh tumor specific expansion cohorts um and these expansion cohorts are currently in the process of being defined now for our p one combination plans um based on the interesting data we have seen with pd one in combination with afm thirteen which aren't referred to uh with a uh very encouraging complete risk bones rate uh in excess of forty percent uh we plan to have a combination with a pd one or pdl one inhibitor open rather soon probably uh in parallel to the less cohorts of the dose escalation of the single agent study so it will be more or less a parallel development that we are anticipating right now great okay thanks for the additional perspective any follow-up questions no i will not proceed in the next question next question it comes from the line of jim <unk> from los fargo please go ahead jim yeah hi guys congrats on all the progress um maybe just a first quick question for angus uh to start him off um collaborative research revenues is that expected to be a stable number between the you know three to four million dollar level or is there any reason that might go up as programs progress and as we think about the milestone got paid in the third quarter is it a simple matter to back out the assumptions around collaborative research revenues and that'll give us some sense of the milestone given that you can't say it explicitly yeah yeah thanks jim for the question so um you know our our revenue numbers fluctuate from quarter to quarter you know based primarily on the number of hours that we're that we're working on um the various genentech programs um that are in progress um i mean you can see just looking back at the last several quarters we've been you know fairly fairly range range pounds and call it the the two million to five million zone um you know when you see increases it's typically a result of point in time milestone payments that we receive so um you know this this this milestone payments um that we discussed today um that we'll that we'll hit in the third quarter um we'll we'll likely increase our revenues in the third quarter and that would be sort of an add on to the to the range that you've seen over the last several quarters of that again kind of to the uh to the five a million dollars two or three to five million years rather got it okay that's that's helpful and then maybe just on um cohort one for afm twenty four and what we might learn from that cohort um can you remind us if you're pre and post biopsy and what kind of translational work you might be doing and you know how that might inform you know the ability to recruit um in eight cells to the tumor site yeah um so the dose escalation part um we do a pre treatment biopsy uh post or on treatment biopsies are optional uh we do have a significant correlative science program looking at at uh ferral activation markers of nk cells as well as on cytokine profiles uh once we are in the expansion of phase so we are recruiting into tumor specific cohorts of the this is uh the part where we will get most of the correlative science as we have a more homogeneous patient population uh we maintain our requirement for a pre-treatment biopsy and uh will have post or on treat biopsies and selected cohorts and then just you know um given the comments on the variability and peripheral nk cell um uh populations um is there any sense in screening patients for their nk cell levels um given that you know patients who screen low may not have adequate nk cells or macrophages to recruit or you feel like within the variability of in a cell um in the blood that that you'll be able to have an effective treatment and it's not worth screening for that variable uh i think currently it would be uh premature to yeah it depends on what you mean with with screening so we are definitely determining the uh levels of circulating nk cells and also looking at some of their characteristics i think we currently do not have enough data to define a cutoff or a threshold and this may very well very between uh tumor histologies and also be dependent on uh the infiltration of nk cells in the tumor micro environment um variable which we have seen in our af and columbia study to have some impact on on the likelihood to respond to patients of patients so think in the beginning of the program we will be all and for all comers we will assess all of this important biomarkers and then based on the activity data and the readouts that we are seeing we may modify as a program defining certain thresholds but currently i think it will be pretty mature to do that and maybe just a final question just um the md anderson collaboration is focused on cord blood derive nk cells is there any thought to other nk cell sources including um potentially ipsc derived nk cells um uh do you want to take this question or should i take it no well i under why don't you go ahead okay uh yeah you're right ring court blood derived nk cells is one source of nk cells and if you uh watch the field of nk cell um based approaches especially as the field uh around companies and institutes uh providing different sources of nk cells there's definitely uh speed picking up and uh there's a variety of options to to look at and this is what we do um not only from our side but uh we have also received uh proactive inquiries of uh potential um working models together so we are looking at the entire nk cell field and then evaluate various options there great thanks for taking the questions guys maybe as a good comment so we see this um uh completely rift in cases already quite advanced in clinical development so they have already been uh many patients treated while with the ipscs currently uh there is still a um the safety to be determined in the uh obviously in combination we learn more on the functionalities so this is uh somewhat uh it uh to us on how functional and it's the right versus a peripheral in case a list and it's good to see the first case of the data so we're quite uh uh not only happy but uh we've we've checked so many different options at the moment for in cases and we're indeed very convinced about uh the activity of the corporate derived cells from uh md and great thanks adi thank you our next question comes from the line of i og from bmo capital the line is now open please go ahead hey good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions this is ek on for do kim uh just a couple regarding the bcma and they engage her uh i understand that you probably have limited visibility on the entire of the clinical building pathway um but if you can provide any type of insight in terms of what genetic uh kind of has planned maybe in terms of could it potentially pursue an accelerated pathway um for the assets and secondly uh again you don't provide uh complete details on the exact milestone payments but if you could provide some of the perspective on what the future milestones uh but asset might hold um in terms of uh you know phase two phase three things of that sort uh should we expect increasing size of that for each milestone payments uh that'd be helpful for us thanks adi maybe i take the question on the pathway and then hand over to you with the milestone yes please go ahead so yeah thanks for the question i mean as you already correctly say we cannot really speak in detail for genetic but we can share with you i think you're aware of course um licensing this molecule was a big part of the deal with the genetic they're obviously excited about the strong differentiation potential of the molecule also demonstrated at acr at the poster just to review again a very strong uh frequent go south killing selected no southern release very good safety profile and good pharmacodynamic marker specific bcma plus myself killing in the center of monkey so you know despite the also recent approvals of the you know income first encomers in the space um i would say that genetic shares our excitement with a differentiation potential in a way for a potentially best in class molecule maybe i i leave it there i think it's it's a it's a clearly um a strongly clinically validated space and i think this molecule will enable uh and we as their partner to you know have a strong position in this space uh yeah regarding the financials so i just wanna recall the deal uh when it was signed uh so we received ninety six million in an upfront cash and uh a uh and and can get a total of uh more than five billion in milestones that uh are uh in different categories so there are a pretend model there's a pretend model some payments there are indeed multiple clinical milestone payments regulatory and sales milestones and on top we can receive relatives which as we described are on the higher end of uh what you would expect for the early nature of the uh uh license uh agreement uh beyond that we're not able to disclose any further details uh unless uh china and it would allow us or rush would allow us to do so usually that's just the general statement is that the payments will increase the further the program progresses okay thank you for that and just one a quick question uh i think i might have missed her this is in regards to afm twenty four uh i believe you mentioned that there was a patient uh that had increased in all six side of kind levels that would resolved over twenty four hours i'm just curious was that self resolving or did that patient receive and uh al six inhibitor yeah i can uh thanks for bringing that up in clarification so the transient uh six increase was reported in the <unk> <unk> study what you you referred to the acr poster indeed we saw that with the dosing a kind of moderate peak that quickly meant down was completely result uh without any any treatment obviously you know one doesn't do that in the because this is you know talk study and again when we see this in the context because of a transient fully reversed leads us to the conclusion which of course will be looked at carefully in patients that we should not expect any kind of cytokine release syndrome okay thank you for that clarification sure thank you next question comes from line of year january from meeting your company if you go ahead and line yourself okay hello yes hello yeah hi can you hear you hi uh sorry that's uh my message follow up uh thanks for taking the questions my first question is that uh for the m thirteen in the for the registration study that uh it's assignment two uh set up so uh what might be the threshold of or in the forty patient and sort of internal readout before you can move forward so just carry so what any information is gonna reveal on that front um fright we cannot give um a concrete response rate it's based also on the beijing design so there are some in the dependence of response rates but uh we usually do not disclose thresholds but it's a classical assignment to stage design okay no problem and also just curious in terms of afm twenty four or that you are dose escalating but at least based on the animal data is any thoughts where when you might start to see the potential effective dose to start to uh i think currently it's not possible to predict uh when we will have the optimal uh biologically active those um as there are a number of covariants like binding sites for cd six steam finding science for egfr and then distribution um and as you know the the animal models especially in terms of pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are very uh difficult to translate um the relevant talk species and after that that's only talk species it's the symmogus monkey uh however we do not have any uh symmogus monkey two more models available so we cannot really bridge between what we see in the toxicology studies and then what we would see in terms of efficacy for for tumors so it will be something that we will have to define in our in our clinical pro program okay great maybe what uh stick in one last question here is that uh uh in terms of adaptive uh in k cell uh from <unk> driving k cell uh it's first of all could that be potentially use and started tumor and uh any comments comments in terms of uh regarding that uh possibility uh this is a i said something that we are actively looking into um we are starting out with uh lymphomas obviously with afm thirteen targeting cd thirty but our vision is uh that at also for fm twenty four we will develop uh certain development options in combination with nk cells uh could be court blood arrived in k cells could be nk cells from another source uh and that something that we will define but the intention is also to to have a have a program where afm twenty four would be part that was um exogenous nk cells okay great thanks uh appreciate and some great for all the products this fall and look for the question at this time for any closing remarks please go ahead speakers um yeah thank you again for uh listening in and uh following our uh our updates um the uh the progress is uh coming mostly along despite that uh we are affected by uh by co it uh we have strengths in the team significantly in order to address any issues that may relate to the uh conductance of this clinical trials or uh to the um uh interactions with the with the specific uh aside so we're very happy to be able to uh have have been able to address uh any of the issues that have uh been rising and i indeed want to thank again uh the entire team here at document uh for uh managing all that through this uh difficult times uh we're quite excited uh that uh we can move forward uh these programs either it's monotherapies and uh now looking at the different options of uh of combination uh if you've heard we've focus on natural killer cells and checkpoint inhibitors in particular pd ones or pd ones so we feel that uh we have uh with the multiple programs uh addressing different targets uh we can provide a guidance of data over the next uh quarters and uh in years and uh very happy to report any additional updates as we move along thanks a lot again for listening in and uh all the best good point thank you listen to the conference of the date and your participate email connect speak to everyone thank you
