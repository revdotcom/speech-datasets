please proceed thanks operator and thank you all for joining us today in our preliminary results we said we expected to beat the aggressive growth projections we outlined on our second quarter call including eighty percent growth in r f i d for the fully year twenty percent sequential growth and physical security from q2 to q3 and federal sales of eighty percent sequentially with our finalized financial results we're confirming that we beat each of those expectations and shows both strong industry trends driving our business and our leadership within the industry overall revenues grew thirty percent sequentially to twenty four point nine million showing strength across the business we projected our front this business which is about two thirds federal to grow twenty percent sequentially we actually grew twenty six percent sequentially in premises our r f i d business grew more than fifty percent sequentially and over a hundred percent year over year has on track for a percent full year growth and our federal revenues grew nearly ninety percent sequentially so this has us lined up for a strong fourth quarter and the second half of the year that'll be more than thirty percent higher than our first half we're seeing business moment momentum continuing backlog building and the pipeline for twenty twenty one becoming stronger but before we talk too much about the future let's review the operational and financial results for the third quarter now our key focus areas of our f i d and our federal business were particularly strong within our identity business which is predominantly r f i d revenue increased sequentially by thirty three percent to fifteen point four million and year over year identity in total grew fifty three percent from ten point one million in q3 twenty nineteen to fifteen point four million in q3 twenty twenty the growth was mainly driven by r f i d a course where we ramped up production volumes for a number of customers in particular a major customer whose production started in q2 came through through in q3 even stronger than we expected as a result our rf id business more than doubled the volume we produced a year ago even with our ramp up there was nearly a million dollars shipments we didn't fulfill we balanced customer requirements to make sure the most critical deliveries were covered now the business implication is that the industry launches we expected are well underway the mass mark good adoption of rf id integrated products that's happening our major customers are incorporated rf id devices into healthcare products mobility consumer products appliances libraries pharmaceuticals and up enabling the physical world the point is that each of these are a hundred million or billion plus united applications it's a huge market that's just beginning to grow the overall trend clearly showed in our third quarter results as well as in the continuing backlog strength before he went into the fourth order with backlog for fourth quarter shipments up sixty eight percent over last year and we'll talk about the implications going forward of all these translator on the call also with an identity in the third quarter our identity readers grew strongly how thirty eight percent over the last year's third quarter and we all expected the work from home trend plateau after the initial lockdowns in the spring but this really shows that demand is continuing the third quarter is always strong for smart guard readers because of the federal year end so the growth comes over and normally strong year prior period the reason is that the federal government and especially the dod are adopting policies supporting work from home and work mobile for the long term so we do expect these trends to sustain we'll talk more about the as we as we look at twenty twenty one so turning to our premises business in q3 this shows the strength of our whole product range as well as of our federal government focus as i mentioned before premises grew twenty six percent sequentially the federal business for our velocity security platform was the strongest vertical from ninety percent sequentially but we also saw activity in banking retail utilities and others for example in financial services we quoted our first large lead to our crime managed video services order which is now closed the leading banks adopting our platform across almost a hundred branches the six years six hundred fifty thousand dollars agreement provides video surveillance analytics and case management on subscription basis setting tens of thousands of dollars in capital expense to our customer and ensuring a predictable revenue stream of over a hundred thousand dollars annually for our business that'll be clear we've had continuing strong business part within our industries some small dealers and small businesses are under pressure as are our competitors who focused there now since federal state and local government customers are more than two thirds of the business for our physical access platforms we're seeing strong performance and premise us and our quick pivot to recurring revenues with lower cost of entry has put us in a strong position overall these includes our velocity service product mobile s id three vr prime our freedom cloud and freedom mobile which we just launched this week all of these are recurring revenue products all launched in the last twelve months now as we talked about in the second quarter the broad adoption of r f i d and our major customers core products is what really gives us reason to believe this growth is a long-term trend that we're just starting to see take off it's building backlog for the fourth quarter and for twenty twenty one so overall the court the third quarter was highlighted by thirty percent sequential revenue growth over a hundred percent year of year if i need growth a ninety percent sequential growth in federal sales thirty eight percent year over year identity reader growth and q4 backlog up sixty eight percent the last year there's certainly are challenges in the economic environment we're all in but the strongest growth we're experiencing r s i d our strength and federal work from home going into a second way demand and the products we've launched in the third quarter to take advantage of return to work needs to build the base for a strong fourth quarter and twenty twenty one so let me turn it over to sandra to go through the third quarter financial results afterwards i'll go into more metrics and the industry-wide trends that are really accelerating our business into the fourth quarter and into twenty twenty one sandra and steve mentioned our results show the continued delivery of what we committed with a solid trajectory for twenty twenty one please note that these results are all within the preliminary results announced october twenty ninth prior to market open the first metric is revenue growth even with the continued impact of covid nineteen we closed out the third quarter of twenty twenty with twenty four point nine million in total revenue up thirty percent compared to the second quarter of twenty twenty and up eight percent can here to the third quarter of twenty nineteen our recurring revenue accounted for six percent of our third quarter revenue and eight percent of our total revenue in the first nine months of twenty twenty this part of our business remains steady at eight percent of our two trailing twelve month revenue for the third quarter of twenty twenty our gap and non gap adjusted gross profit margins for forty and forty one percent respectively for the trailing twelve month period our non gap adjusted gross profit margin was forty two percent for the third quarter twenty twenty or non gap adjusted ebitda margin was positive eleven percent with a positive four percent for the trailing twelve month period our gap mid income for the third quarter twenty with zero point four million compared with a loss of two point seven million in q2 twenty twenty and that income of one point one million in q3 twenty nineteen with the dividends on the series be preferred are gap net income attributable to stockholders with zero point one million or net income of one cent per share compared with a loss of seventeen cents per share in q2 twenty twenty and positive five cents per share thank you the three of twenty nineteen we have provided in in the appendix a full by facilitation of gap to non-depth information which is also included in our earnings release on our next slide for further analyzing trends by segment our premises segment which includes sales of physical access control and video product video products and services accounted for nine point four million or thirty eight percent of our total revenue in q3 representing increase in dollars of twenty six percent from q2 twenty twenty and a decrease of twenty seven percent from q3 twenty nineteen revenue from our identity products which includes sales of access credentials smart card readers r f i d transsponders and mobile security products total fifteen point four million or sixty two percent of our total revenue in q3 twenty twenty and increase of dollars of thirty three percent from q2 twenty twenty and it increases fifty three percent from q3 twenty nineteen our non gap gross profit was forty one percent in the third quarter of twenty twenty this compares with forty two percent in q2 twenty and forty seven percent in q3 twenty nineteen driven by both the mix of product across segments and within segments our premises segment margins for fifty five percent relatively flat compared to twenty twenty and q3 twenty nineteen at fifty five and fifty six percent respectively our identity segment margins for thirty percent relatively flat compared to q2 twenty twenty at thirty one percent and lower than q3 twenty nineteen at thirty three percent due to a higher proportion of lower margin transponder sales now moving to our operating expense management our gap operating expenses for the third quarter for eight point nine million which was down from ten million in q2 twenty twenty and down year over year from nine point three million in q3 twenty nineteen the sequential decrease was primarily due to the i'm recurring one point two million restructuring spent in q2 twenty twenty our non gap operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to thirty percent in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with forty percent in the second quarter of twenty twenty and thirty four percent in the third quarter of twenty nineteen our non-cap operating expenses total seven point five million in the third quarter of twenty twenty this compares to seven point six million in q2 twenty twenty and seven point nine million in q3 of twenty nineteen bringing all the pieces back together our non gap adjusted ebitda was two point eight million in the third quarter of twenty twenty that's the point still increase of two point three million over two twenty twenty turning to the balance sheet will be comparing our position at september twenty twenty to the position one quarter ago at june twenty twenty and the prior year quarter and in september twenty nineteen we exited the third quarter with cash at twelve point three million a net decrease of zero point eight million from q2 twenty twenty and a one point two million increase from q3 twenty nineteen net cash activity for the quarter was driven by two point two million of cash provided by our net income excluding non-cash items three point six million of cash used for working capital and capex driven primarily by late q3 billings that were not collectible within the quarter and by an increase in working capital to support our singapore growth under financing and foreign currency we had a zero point six million net cash provided driven by a zero point nine million increase in net borrowings under our revolver and a zero point five million reduction through scheduled payments on the term loan facility we believe that we have adequate capital available to fund our business square and return to positive non-cap free cash flow exit in q4 twenty twenty as well as retiring the term a note that on schedule in q1 twenty twenty one in our ten q filings we will be providing a full right consolidation of the year to date cash flows for completeness we've included the full balance sheet for the earnings release in the appendix even with the global disruption continuing today we are confirming our guidance for the consolidate results of the company for full year twenty twenty at revenue between eighty six and eighty eight million within our original guidance entering this year we achieved gap eps profitability in q3 twenty twenty ahead of expectations and continues to see the benefits of our actions to optimize cost carry forward in addition we believe we will be non gap free cash flow positive as committed during q4 twenty twenty and beyond in addition today we're providing guidance for the full year twenty twenty one building on the strong base of growth that we have delivered our full year twenty twenty one guidance is for revenue between ninety six and one hundred and two million which reflects growth year over year from the mid point of our twenty twenty guidance exceeding the market growth by a factor of two we expect our normal seasonality to continue with our lowest quarter in q1 twenty twenty one and building up quarter over quarter through the end of twenty twenty one we will be issuing a full set of guidance at rq four and full year twenty twenty earnings released targeted for march twenty twenty one with that i will conclude the financial discussion and pass it back to steve the sandra as i said earlier our r f i d growth is predictable for two reasons it's heavily backlog driven and it's driven by major companies who have incorporated our r f i d devices into their products planning for global products is a year long a process so even now we're getting visibility into plans throughout twenty twenty one first backlog going into the fourth quarter our total backlog should at ten point five million up sixty eight percent for last year and our r i d backlog for shipment in the fourth quarter is up a hundred and twenty five percent over last year we've now gotten in orders for about many five percent of our expected shipments for the quarter in r f i d and that means most additional orders either contribute to upside within the quarter or drive more backlog for twenty twenty one this is a key driver of our growth for twenty twenty one and we expect the r f i d portion of our business to grow well over fifty percent in the first half of twenty twenty one versus the first half of twenty twenty the full year growth in the mid twenty percent range for twenty twenty one now the core driver of our r f i d business is the mass market adoption of r f i d integrated products our customers are leaders in their own industries incorporating r f i d devices into their products each with volumes of tens or hundreds of millions of units so this is a huge market that's just beginning to grow in the third quarter two strong use cases were launched in the market one by cvs and the other of course by apple now we don't generally disclose customers so these are just industry examples to be clear but both are great examples of the rf id market accelerating they're both basic uses to establish platforms to then drive multiple products from already big first launches so the first some of you saw in the demo session we had a couple of weeks back cbs has spoken rx for visually impaired people you tapped your phone to the rfi detag on the prescription bottle and it reads up the medication with dosage and all the other information for people who can't read the label now about thirteen percent of prescriptions go to people with some visual impairment and they're about four and a half billion prescriptions annually so in the u s alone that's over half a billion rfi detags every year just for the visual impaired sector now that's the current use case in the first use case so so now extrapolate with the platform deployed every cvs pharmacy now is set up to program and put rf id tags on every prescription and that's really where they should be everyone so when you open your prescription bottles you tap each time you take it you'll know if you've taken it morning or evening or whatever the prescription regimen is it'll auto refill as you get low there's all kinds of capabilities you can do there you can even opt in and your doctor could get information about how consistently you're taking your meds because anyone who studies this area knows that that the biggest issue with the prescription pharmaceuticals is people complying with taking their meds so there's a number of things that companies like cvs are thinking about now that they've made that additional investment they can really expand into into other categories so ultimately we think the opportunity is for all four and a half billion of the prescription in the us annually the us is about a quarter of the world prescriptions so again you can see for the visually impaired application it's a couple of billion units worldwide and nearly twenty billion units for all prescriptions worldwide now of course it's gonna take time but you can see the volume of potential and again the investment's really now done and of cour the reader in the app technology is already in everybody's pockets in their phones now related to the mobile space and the phones the biggest event of course was apple's launch a full nfc support in ios fourteen and the iphone twelve especially the new ecosystem of products around nineteen so apples made it very easy and secure to connect peripherals to the iphone and then through nsc to connect them into core iphone features so just as a couple of examples um the first apple branded cases for example if you buy an orange case you pop it on your phone the screen turns orange it goes through an animation you know you've connected it and you know it's an apple verified phone it seems pretty trivial but what it's showing is the referrals are actually communicating securely with the phone launching processes in the phone and all secured and controlled by apple through a secure nfc way but if it's enables a whole world of new peripherals to connect to the phone and seamlessly but securely launch apps and experiences so this is really the vision for this type of connected device that that apple's deploying and with over two hundred million iphones shift a year connecting multiple mag safe enabled devices each again you can see the market in a billion unit plus range january now additionally of course we're apple and cvs go samsung walgreens amazon pharmacy and others have to match so you can see the scale of the markets we're going after and the volumes that already you're happening so our idea of gaining traction right now we've been the trusted code developer and supplier for some of the most advanced applications and the most demanding companies this is where the growth is and it's where our competitive advantage is strongest so how are we gonna keep our advantage we're expanding our technical capabilities and for twenty twenty one we're launching services to help companies put r f i d into their products now we're unique in our ability to go from concept to optimize design to early for to scaling production and then to immediately start back into the next generation of devices and this is exactly the cycle that the customers need we're also innovating with new products answering needs we know from our own customers and it's apple is a new product we've launched what we think is the industry's lowest carbon footprint r f i d tag or ecotag instead of being an edged antenna on a plastic substrate we've developed a unique laser cutting process and it's on recyclable pay or substrate we even use recite aluminum for the antenna so there's no etching chemicals no loss metal no plastic layers no chemical runoff now why do we do all this well the biggest users have high end rf id are consumer facing companies and sustainability matters to them companies like amazon and apple have a public commitment to being carbon neutral and art by details are consumer visible devices so our ecotag shows their eco commitment and a limit that's what otherwise would be a negative on their carbon footprint now our customers told us this is what they want it's very tricky technology but we developed it and fundamentally this is exactly why we're gonna keep our leads in the fast growing art by d market so that's rf id now let's look at premises which has some similarly exciting opportunities and remember the core technology and our rfi detail is shared with our access cards door readers identity readers and other parts of our physical and data secure solutions so one growth driver really supports the other so with the premises industry overall growing about six percent we grew twenty six percent sequentially and we're expecting premises to grow about twenty five percent year over year this order for twenty twenty one we expect growth in the mid teens more than double the industry rate now the fundamental drivers are recurring revenue growth the shift to it driven buyers and federal growth so why will we be growing faster than the market with these dynamics just like an r f i d we're both the trusted provider and we've got some of the most advanced technology and brought us product range as customers moved to software defined platforms they need to migrate their entire platform across readers credentials controllers access video and audio and it's all gotta be integrated with their active directory or other sensitive data repository now we're the only company that delivers all of this and we think total solutions and i eccentric recurring revenue platforms will be the fastest growth sector in physical security and the strategic position of combined access video and audio management is the key for anyone trying to win a great example of this is our freedom cloud platform that we just launched this week it's the lightest weight implementation in the industry totally web and mobile base and especially on the hardware side our freedom bridges are extremely compact and cost effective iot devices of ridge that can control two doors is the size of a pack of playing cards and this is what customers you're looking for hardly know visible really intuitive to deploy and manage and a platform that the it department is totally comfortable owning and managing the software browser based and the hardware is managed just like a network switch so we've described the growth in each segment so to put it together in the fourth quarter we're expecting overall revenues to grow in the twenty five to thirty percent year of the year range so looking at the business drivers for next year we have r f i d use cases that each can be hundreds of millions of units over time and give us clear line of sight into twenty twenty one there's strong federal government demand for a good security identity readers and mobility gaps and our complete range recurring revenue products is now in place that with all these growth drivers we could see faster growth in any given quarter but to keep our predictability we've given a strong base growth outlook and we'll update as we get further into the markets take off the twenty twenty has been a challenging year but we're in markets that are taking off and we've been able to strengthen our leadership even if they're accelerating the result is we're looking forward to a strong finish to the year and then exciting twenty twenty one so with that let me open the discussion to questions operator ladies and thank you ladies and gentlemen we will now take questions if you do have any question please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time if you're using a speaker phone we ask that while posing your question you pick up your handset to provide the best sound quality again ladies and gentlemen if you do have a question or comments please press star one on your telephone keypad at this time we'll take our first question from jason smith with lake street capital market please go ahead hey guys thanks for taking my questions uh steve appreciate all the color and sort of why you're feeling so confident in twenty twenty one but curious if you could talk about sorry it's a backlog coverage to twenty twenty one and if some of this confidence is really just driven by some sizeable orders already in hand or if it's just general confidence especially on the r f i d side that you are just seeing going to see this big general adoption yeah thanks for the question jason and yes backlog has been growing nicely i think we earlier in the that uh at the time it was up uh it was doubled from what it had been uh uh just a couple months earlier and i mentioned that we've already got over ninety five percent of our two four shipments already covered in background so all the orders coming in are our twenty twenty one orders and we actually have orders that go throughout all of twenty twenty one um so we've got good visibility both uh front ended you know that said we expected uh the first half of the year already to be um fifty percent grow over uh over the year prior uh and obviously we wouldn't be saying that's clear numbers we didn't have fair amount of visibility in it uh and that's really driven by by our backlog okay that's helpful and in your prepared remarks you noted about a million dollars in business not being able to shift in q3 could you just comment on what sort of constraints you're seeing there and if those constraints have used now in q4 yeah also thanks for picking up on that one um yeah as i mentioned in the second quarter call we've been expanding our capacity rapidly but when you you know when you look at uh doubling your capacity uh and then we talked about in q4 or we've got a backlog day you know a hundred twenty five percent of the the year prior uh that that's indicating you know more than double where years year ago um we're building out uh uh space and we're putting in more equipment um and some of the devices that we're producing are particularly complicated in high end which is great for us because it's uh uh it's more differentiated um but they take more uh machine capacity because there's multiple process with multiple passes um versus some of the more straightforward products and that those of course the more complicated products often go to the more sensitive and high-end customers so we always want to favor those and so we did uh uh have some that we couldn't ship we're catching up in this quarter um and we'll have the capacity built out uh by the end of this quarter and again we talked about building capacity we're talking you know a hundred hundred fifty grand in uh in facilities um you know build out and uh and a few hundred thousand dollars in equipment it's not a major uh capital absorption um but we have been catching up through the third quarter and uh we'll be all caught up in a good shape uh going into twenty twenty okay and then just the last one and i'll jump back into queue i mean obviously the school and education market could be a little challenging with budgetary pressures and whatnot but just curious if you could comment on what your expectations in that market are going forward it is choppy as you say but it's also um uh you know highly motivated for security uh you know we put out a white paper on the um remote school in cyber security for example with our phyto keys that we just launched you know one of the dirty secrets that a lot of people haven't you know focused on is we've taken all the kids in our country and and put 'em online to to go to school and if any think that we've actually properly secured their their data pipes uh for their learning um they're they're they're being a little optimistic and so there's opportunities there for example to cyber secure uh more of the uh uh the this learning environment and there's also as we go back to school um physical security is as important as ever and especially physical security infrastructure is now being integrated with with with health and safety infrastructure so there's opportunities there we're seeing a lot of you know interest in bids but also you know schools are in financial you know challenges and so some of them are going ahead you know fast and some of them are really frankly hunker down so i don't know on a month by month basis how it's going to emerge um but from a market opportunity you know over the course of the next year uh i actually think schools and universities are gonna be a very good segment for us um both on the cybersecurity side and on the health and safety physical security side okay that's really helpful thanks a lot as a reminder ladies and gentlemen if you do have a question or comment please press jr one on your telephone keypad at this time we'll take our next question from mike lattimore with northland capital markets please go ahead great thanks a lot yeah great quarter there um steve i didn't tell you did you give some guidance on what you thought premises would grow in the fourth quarter i couldn't tell if you did if you said that or not uh specifically for premises in the fourth quarter um i don't know that we i've gotta go back and uh and look at that i know that uh no we did i'm sorry i'm looking at my notes here um you said about twenty five percent year over year uh for uh for the fourth quarter all right so that that's like up sequentially um and is that is that driven by not government or is that government driving that sequential pattern then yeah good question it's it's across the board uh and and uh uh this place government and non-government acts on the growth as i think about underneath the numbers it's uh it's probably more merchant and government uh in terms of increases um sequentially okay okay very good um you know we've seen we have seen a a a rebound in activity uh in uh on the the premises side you know you can only be for these things so long and uh mm-hmm uh and now a lot of the installers some of these are are getting out there getting back in line also customers um you know uh things like video systems where microsoft stops supporting you know windows seven or something they they have to do something so there's uh there's uh a built in um you know migration and growth pattern that uh we're starting to see come back yeah okay got it and then on the identity just it seems like a a ton of opportunity there um i guess how how diverse do you see that revenue stream being in terms of you know customer base over the next year is it gonna be you know very diverse or is it gonna be a couple big customers really driving the growth um are you asking primarily about rfd and identity yes yeah uh so actually i think it's gonna be quite diverse uh certainly when some of these you know global corporations uh you know launch their numbers are big but um there's uh there's several of them that are uh you know either already launching or in pilot and building in the launch for twenty twenty one um and you might have noticed we didn't have any you know ten percent concentrate and customers uh you know disclosed so um it's certainly some uh some uh gorillas uh but uh but a range of them and the other interesting thing is a range of applications uh that are not just in one vertical uh either there's uh there's several different use cases that are uh that are getting momentum okay and then um you have a number of cloud offerings now you know i'm sure you're gonna be promoting at even more aggressively next year i mean well what would be you know when you when you book a cloud deal it doesn't always show up within the quarter year obviously but like what what would be sort of a good amount of cloud booking for next year if you're successful is it you know a million dollars is it five million like a like what would be a successful cloud looking at your well um i think uh we're we're just you know learning what the profile looks like but i think uh you know the the six year six hundred fifty thousand dollars uh okay thanks installation that we did is is on the high end but it's characteristic of how those things work so if you mean how much we recognized within the year um you know probably you know a couple of few million dollars uh incremental to the to the sixty eight percent were already asked but that would represent of course five to six times that much in terms of you know book business yeah i guess that that was more what i was referring to okay great yeah okay good that's fine that's fine at this time this concludes our company's question and answer session if your question was not taken you may contact identities investor relations team at i n v e at gateway dot com i'd now like to turn the call back over to mr humphreys for his closing remarks all right and uh and operator just want to confirm we don't have any other questions in there that's right no further questions in the queue at this time sure all right thank you very much well um thank you all for joining us very much appreciate it also uh please join us at uh some of the virtual investor events coming up this quarter um we've got uh imperial capital the first week in december and uh northland uh week after that so uh uh look forward to continuing to update you on the business and until then uh best wishes do well be safe and have a good evening thank you ladies and gentleman this does conclude today's teleconference we thank you again for your participation you may disconnect your lines at this time have a great day
