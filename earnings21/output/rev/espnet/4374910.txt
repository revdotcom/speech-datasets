good morning this is craig moore with autonomous thanks for joining us this morning for our fifth annual future of commerce symposium sorry for the brief delay in getting i just wanted to mention a few housekeeping items before we get started um you can use the same dial-in or web link for the entire day there'll be a few breaks but for many of the sessions we will just move right into the next uh the next discussion you can submit questions uh to us via uh email to myself or ken sahaski uh you can also use bloomberg ib to find us with questions or you can use the q and a box within uh your zoom window um so with with no further ado let's get started um we're lucky to have with us this morning american express doug buckmans group head global consumer services it's great to see you again doug i wish it was in person i wish it was in carnegie hall but maybe next year how are you exactly it's great great to see you too craig thanks for having me yeah you bet um so um love the background i love the image um but let me uh why don't we get started with just you know a a broad question which is you know can you update us on the state of consumer and overall spend think at this point in the recovery yeah you know i i think um as we've talked about before we saw the trough in april and we've seen a rebound since then you know i would characterize uh the trends since mid july lie as relatively stable on the non t e side so outside of t e relatively stable little bouncing around due to days mix timing of holidays like labor day in particular and slow very steady growth but but slow growth on the t and e side right so i would say stable would be the the adjective the captures at best okay um at this point i assume could we perhaps characterize this a little go a little deeper on this x t and e um if you were to characterize the overall volumes you're seeing x t e x corporate card you know really are consumers getting back toward positive territory within credit card portfolios at this point yeah i mean i think you know consumers consumer right they're gonna figure out a way to live their life and um and enrich their lives and i would say well there's a lot of substitution in the non dna space especially physical for for online and e-com i would say we feel good the healthy levels of consumer volumes there um i think what's gonna what's gonna define the trajectory of uh volume rebound from here on out is uh is the direction of t and e which which you know is category uh we over-index on so maybe some thoughts there you know mx has a deeper understanding of team than i think any other card issue especially considering the network and the insights you get off of that um on a global basis so maybe uh your thoughts on how we recover from this are there any green shoots you're seeing in tv at all at this point i mean i think um you know my position is consumer travel will come back um i think that's our our enterprise position is that we expect consumer travel to come back it's an essential part of uh the consumer experience especially in our demographic um i think you know what we've seen to date in terms of the rebound is an effect of substitution so people substituting to diving vacations home stay rentals for you know uh for airbase travel and in some categories we've seen innovation as well right i'm saying the dining space in particular expansion about door dining pick up takeaway delivery at home meal prep uh that level of innovation has uh has bounced uh the restaurant category more than you would expect just from dying in volumes alone right um so i think you know where when we get back to historic levels i think is is largely a question of of confidence and medical solutions right i think uh i think uh the establishment of a vaccine the approval of the vaccine i expect will unleash a lot of anticipatory and pent up demand on consumers they will start travel planning again the interest in travel-based payment pro and travel based loyalty currencies i think will will spike is all that pent up demand for travel people start to see the end in sight there they start to build confidence that in a six twelve month time period uh they'll be able to travel again but i think getting back to historic uh volumes is gonna require them mm-hmm and in terms of how that affects the discount rate at american express um especially without the long haul the long haul travel um maybe a discussion there just briefly remind investors how that dynamic is playing out yeah well there's no there's no question that um that t and e volumes taking a disproportionate hit like this does have a mixed related impact on our discount rate right so i think um you know the discount rate and we we've been on record for a few years now saying we we grind down less on absolute discount rate and are focused on driving discount revenue and utility through programs like uh blue certain b2b cal um but there's no question you know that historic discount rate has taken a mix related impact as a result of really a disproportionate fall in uh in t and e t e spend uh okay well we'll we'll move off of that that topic that isn't helpful right now in terms of the dynamic but maybe onto something that is which is you know can you discuss how spending habits have changed you know and to what degree you're seeing these habits you know coalesce into long-term repeatable behavior you know especially around e-comm contactless and if it's different between consumer segments yeah you know i think um my take on the effects of this crisis are that it didn't create any new trends but it changed sort of the slope of preexisting trends right honors was taking share from offline digital payments were taking share from cash at pos right and we have seen uh an inflection or a kink in those curbs uh as most issuers have over the last uh six months you know whether we've seen those trends accelerated by year two years it's anybody's guess but i don't think i don't think we're going backwards from those trends as the crisis uh as the crisis from relaxes um you know i think on the contactless side you know there's a lot of noise around that there are markets outside the us as you know southeast asia australia the uk where there's very deep uh of contactless penetration and um and that has continued to gain share during this crisis in the us the contactless volumes are much more modest they are increasing at a rapid rate but i do expect that the move away from cash and the comfort with using credit products even for micro level transactions at pos uh will be an enduring outcome of this and i think um while i don't think it does a lot per se to drive dollar volumes of billings i think it does a lot to build habit and wallet position of credit products and in some markets outside the us where econ is less established it's had a more profound effect like italy is a face-to-face retail market we've seen phenomenal growth in e-commerce what's interesting is well over fifty percent of the participants in e-commerce in any month during the first few months of the crisis had never had any e-commerce transaction on amex before wow um so there we've seen some real um i i again i think it's a trans it would've played out but it was a very large acceleration of that trend and correct me if i'm wrong but amex has a a better acceptance footprint outside the us in ecomm than it as in brick and mortar uh yeah i would say that's probably true uh by and large due to partnerships with various psps and aggregators and such we have a really strong footprint in in ecom okay um so in terms of uh the health of the us consumer the health of the consumer in general you know especially considering high higher unemployment furloughs unemployment claim you know as we saw this morning um it's been remarkable how well the industry is fairing right now um you know i noticed that amex is uh credit quality is at its best point of of the last twelve months on consumer and shockingly it's best point over the last three years in small business and so maybe some context there you know discover uh ceo did cause some concern the other day by saying they expect a material uplift in credit quality metrics later this year so just your perspective yeah i mean um look i think most issuers have seen a more modest impact than would have been implied by the end of q1 qualitative results that they took right i think looking at macro indicators around unemployment plan and changes in sequential gdp you know uh if you were sitting back being an armchair credit manager you would've expected um much larger and negative impacts on delinquency and write-offs and the act the matter is as you think we have uh we have not seen them as most issuers haven't played out by and large now there are a number of contributors to that right i would say the jobless claims the geography of those the demographics of those jobless claims you know uh uh weren't as concentrated in our customer base our member base um as the macro numbers would suggest uh i would also say as everyone knows there's just a on of liquidity in the system right now whether it's through government programs private sector for barren's programs um and so you're right we have we have credit walling and delinquency and right off side that are better year on year uh than uh than they were um you know i think we have to while while we're pleased with that we also have a healthy level of you know paranoid about what the next twelve months will bring right the macro economy some of these forbearance programs with ten percent of residential mortgages being in forbearance that kind of going away government support um mot rating perhaps private sector follow through in terms of white collar job losses so you know we feel great about the early innings of this crisis but you know we're mindful that it's not over you know just are there any signs in the portfolio at all that would be concerning you know look i think in the in the commercial or small business portfolio clearly there are industries that are more affected by this fortunately they tend to be industries where our concentration is uh is lower you know there there are some some things about this crisis have actually improved visibility in a way i mean we have really good visibility into our customers that have entered into forbearance programs with competitors right which allows us to kind of target and think about the precision of our underwriting and existing customer management a little bit more critically but but i would say there are there are no real hotspots within the portfolio right now you know i would say you know back in april may all of us had these sort of short-term crisis relief programs right where payment holiday no interest charged and you know type of thing you do after a natural disaster like a hurricane and we we made a a judgment that we weren't gonna kick the can down the road by continuing to extend those programs we were gonna we were gonna move customers if they needed to move onto longer term solutions for repayment confidence right so our twelve month financial relief program which you know allows customers to reduce their uh minimum payment maintain their membership they don't get their ship canceled and retain some level of spend utility as well right and we think that uh that that has allowed us to transition the portfolio um in a very customer friendly way in a way that has s utilize the receivables metrics as well okay um i want to keep this try to keep this conversation with investors so investors are funneling questions to us and we just got one that um i'll just read it for you basically you've made it clear that t and e spend recovery is very linked to covid resolution you know as customers currently divert that spending toward non t and e purchases how is amex able to end increase their share of customer spending in non t e and how meaningfully can that move the needle on billings growth yeah i mean i think it's a great question i mean one of the things you know we did early in this crisis is decide that we were gonna focus on existing customers um the visibility around large scale prospect acquisition was challenged our value propositions tend to index on t and a as we've noted and so we said job one was taken care of existing customers which caused us to make um a long term balance of year um large dollar value commitment to our customers in terms of injecting more relevant right for the time type of value and that could be accelerators in grocery and in dining food delivery or wireless and streaming credits on our our platinum product promotions with amazon and other um other merchant partners and you know we're measuring success right now in terms of how effectively we retain our customers and especially the customers that drive fifty to sixty percent uh of our margin on an annual basis and how well we compete within their wallets for share of wallet and on both of those metrics which we track very closely at a very granular level we feel really good about how well we're competing uh for our customer's business and you know i think we've we've built some confidence here that you know as certain natural hedges in our business take effects of people aren't visiting lounges as much it it frees up resources for us to create new more relevant value for our customers that's what we did this year it has worked for us so far uh we're in the early innings um and we're confident that we can and we'll do the going forward as well you know we also just need to i think think about we we think about our co-brand products as like travel products actually like ninety percent of the spend on a number of our large co-brands is in non-t and e categories right what they're doing is spending in everyday categories to save up and create the opportunity for aspirational travel in the future and so that building base isn't as affect as long as consumers believe in the longterm value of those loyalty currencies and the travel that they can they can gain access to so it sounds like you're implying that the co-brand portfolios are performing the travel related program portfolios are performing no different from other portfolios yeah there are um they're performing no worse than other portfolios look there are portfolios that we have that are doing extraordinarily well right certain retail programs whether it's the small business program with amazon whether it's other department store programs we have outside the us um but if you were to look at our us certainly our cash back products as all cash back products in the industry that rational share value is performing very well but i think we've been on record saying you know say our delta portfolio has experienced a more modest compression of billings than our us portfolios at large interesting well count me one of those co-brand holders with delta hopefully i get to use some of those miles it's point soon i think my family would appreciate that that that's the pent up demand i'm talking about right we all feel that way i'd see my father in six months it's there it's definitely there um so okay um let me ask you about the competitive response that you've seen because clearly amex isn't the only one thinking about these problems amex has historically um kept their spending levels and so and supportive consumers at a higher level through crises and i think that's because of the returns amex has by the network so have you been able to take a lead if you have been and what's been the response yeah you know i um you know they always say crises uh build character they like reveal character to both of individuals and institutions and i've been around mx long time um i'm very proud of the way we've kind of rallied around our customers in this time of crisis i mean in the times of greatest uncertainty uh we signed up for an extraordinary level of value injection both the product level value i described as well as what we've done with our three months shop small program um when we had our least visibility we doubled down on uh on our customer um and as i said earlier i think it's paid real dividends as far as we track um spent share within our members wallets and there's no question that back in like april we took a hit and we have climbed back um as a result of that value injection and some really dialed up customer uh marketing um and as i think steve and jeff both said we see uh retention rates that are sub carrier it's twenty nineteen right now within our base and you know i think we've talked about it before they're better than they were in twenty nineteen and our retention rates in general are just extraordinarily high i mean we we retain the more than ninety eight percent of our billing space year to year okay i don't i don't think i've heard that stat before so that's a that's definitely a good one to write down um so uh wanted to ask about lending lending amex is getting more creative in its lending products there was recently uh a launch of a different lending product associated with platinum um so maybe you can discuss how mx is expanding its lending if you've been successful in getting a greater share of the lend wallet which i believe historically was about half that of the spend share yes so if you can dig into that a little bit that'd be great yeah so your memory is really good uh you know typically we have mid forties um span share and we have uh low twenties uh lending share with a our customers you know i think there's this kind of legacy point of view that our customers don't borrow on credit cards but our customers tend to account for about a third of industry billings on credit and about a third of industry outstandings on credit um and we believe that our customers um uh expect lending or financing capabilities on their payment products and you know we have been growing if you look back twenty nineteen in the three years previous we probably grow grow at two x the industry rate at least some some years three x the industry rate in terms of lending volumes there was a lot of investor concern analyst concern at the time about could we do that prudently would we be able to manage through the next crisis effectively given that or was there a surprise uh a surprise learning one of the things we've said in we remain committed to it is you know we expect to source the majority of our lending growth from within our existing customer base right whether that's installment capabilities term loans or some of the new features you described and for us they're important because not only do customers expect them but they obviously provide some meaningful revenues that we can reinvest into highly competitive value propositions so yes we have put both revolve and transaction based installment capabilities on our full us consumer product set so historic green gold platinum um and we'll be working for a process of introducing those features uh to our members in the current quarters we wanna make sure that you know we don't sound tone depth in terms of the marketing we're doing and what new features we're introducing um but we believe customers expect that and on install and in particular i'm really enthusiastic about that right there's a financial discipline to these closed end installment programs and they resonate tremendously with millennial and younger generations that start getting you to kind of install and important sales type capabilities yeah let me ask you about that because that's it's a hot market it's hard to understand how much it's really penetrated us credit um it seems that the barriers are lower when it comes to an e-commerce transaction for instance uh we believe that a firm will be available to every shopify merchant at the product level as opposed to just the checkout level um on those websites so maybe you can discuss for a minute how you're thinking about those products perhaps leaving in front of amex's ability to lend to its customer because of the placement yeah well i think you know the good thing about um about our planet functionality is our customers go to the point of sale knowing it's available to them and it introduces zero friction and checkout right because on the back end on their app they can opt into a plan of three six twelve months in duration with very transparent fees associated with it um so i think as opposed to having to engage in the purchase path and i think there are a lot of things a firm and shopify others can do to make that point of sale experience more lightweight reduce friction there um but you can't get less friction than we have in that um purchase experience i also think it's a platform that's um has a lot of possibility in terms of innovating with our partners right so if you think about our airline and hotel partners and the capacity to put that in the purchase path to put it um you know uh on their web properties to both remind existing customers of their ability to access that but also to drive card acquisition say an adult to purchase path who you think has powerful potential okay all right um on the card portfolios amex has done uh since steve took over amex has done a phenomenal job of getting products on steady refresh cycles which has had a profound imp act on the rate of growth and net card fees yeah and so has the pandemic caused a delay in that cycle or a delay in the typical new customer account acquisition you expect off of a refresh that might cause um a slow down in those fees and then a re acceleration at some point yeah so i think we have done a really good job of that you know we exited nineteen with north of twenty percent card fee uh growth um and you know this year right before the pandemic hit we actually refreshed our entire delta uh co-brand portfolio and priced for the value in that um so i would say the the pandemic has affected a couple areas um you know i think it's affected our acquisition volumes as i said in q2 we decided to focus on existing customers we pulled back on acquisition that definitely slows the flow of new fee paying customers i think there may be examples where we refresh products and have to think about whether we take price at the time we refresh or whether we defer that fee increased for twelve months i think we are gonna have to be sensitive to the environment but in terms of the commitment to a regular cycle of product refresh adding value and pricing for that value both on the back and the front book we remain committed to that and i think you should expect it um regardless of the environment that twenty twenty one will feature some large scale refreshes as well okay um i want to ask you about all the work you've done to support your co-brand partners especially tina and do you have concern around you know you see some of these announcements that i'm not sure if they're threats or if they're real when a united goes out and says we're getting ready to lay off fifty percent of our domestic staff um delta has clearly not said anything like that but point is how do you view those partners or do you view them as severely distressed and how's alex thinking about that yeah well i mean fundamentally i view them as as under stress as we all are but since i do believe in the return especially of leisure travel um on the back of a vaccine i believe in the long term uh of those partners as well i also happen to think we have we have great partners we have a really premium set of partners whether it's delta whether it's hilton whether it's british airways who we just react with um uh and you know my my view as it was in you know the great financial crisis was these are great times to to lean in build partnership um and invest together to strengthen our joint customer base and that's what we've done right and if you look at the value injections we've done with delta that we've done with mary out that we've done with hilton and these are partners that as you say they're under a fair amount of stress and they have come to the table uh innovated with us co-invested to to make those products appealing even in a travel challenge time and i think you'll see you'll see more of that in twenty one i feel um i feel great about the long term health of the portfolios and i feel really good about the partners okay we have about a minute and i really wanted to get be a chance to answer um mx is really leaned in on digital in terms of assets you've picked up <unk> <unk> cake pocket concierge uh lounge buddy you know to name a but how is that all coming together to support your customers are we gonna see significant changes to the american express mobile app which i think is the best in the industry as it is to bring those to capabilities to bear yeah it's a great it's a great question it's one that's live on our minds as well um and you know i mean the most recent capability based acquisition would've been cavage on the small business side right um and you know we have been on a journey to both digitize our existing products and experiences uh like dining's always been top passionary for our customers right uh um it's you know we have a billion dining transactions it's the number one request into our concierge and travel and so digitizing and adding content there um was sort of a no brainer to us but your your point is is right we have seen through the digitization of our products and servicing a material drop in offline service a large shift to online and that is further fueled by the fact that half of our new customers are under the age of thirty five eighty percent of our acquisitions happen in digital channels and so that trend plus the content we're adding right so you add dining you add installment type capabilities you add you know new sme product sets you know our mobile product and web product are gonna have to flex to make that expanded range of content e easier to navigate for folks there's no question but to your point i think we feel like we started a really strong place right in terms of our own internal assessment as well as external recognition of our mobile product mm-hmm well i'm gonna have to wrap it there doug i really appreciate you joining us i really wanna do this in person next time let's try and do that enjoy the last fleeting days of summer all right you too craig great to see you thank you thank take care of that all right bye
