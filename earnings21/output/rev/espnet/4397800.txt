you for joining our call this morning i'd like to start by walking everyone back from what i hope was a healthy and happy holidays season we are pleased to report improved earnings for the fourth quarter where we achieved the high end of our guidance that we provided in our last quarterly call sales of six hundred sixteen million were six percent sequentially or up six percent sequentially despite similarly in market challenges related to covid nineteen illustrating the benefit of a diverse portfolio of businesses as well as momentum momentum that we're building operationally our fiscal fourth quarter ebitda of twenty eight million dollars grew forty five percent on an ebitda margin increase a hundred fifty his points on a year over year basis despite despite the six percent decline in our revenue our business generated thirty one percent more e d a this quarter than we did in the third quarter and we were able to convert those earnings into cash allowing us to reduce our net debt by over forty million within the quarter we fully participated in increased demand for recreational vehicles and showed market share gain in three out of five product categories while our fire and emergency margins approved throughout the year the commercial segment was able to address an organic drop in sales of a hundred twenty million and limit our full year detrimental ebitda margin during the last nine months we faced difficulties and perhaps unprecedented external challenges while delivering three quarters sequential margin improvement we still have much work remaining and we continue to operate through the challenges with part supply and absenteeism tied to the covid matter however we believe we're in a position to continue to deliver year over year improvements through route the upcoming fiscal year through operational disciplines and capabilities that we are building one important cornerstone that we're committed to establish at rev is to have aligned and unified leadership team that operates under the principles of timely data-driven fact-based decision making with the high sense of ownership and accountability we have spent quite a bit of time in the last few months focused on leadership alignment and organizational structure we've completed our review of the businesses and we have implemented a redesign of our operating model this was a thoughtful examination of how the business operates where decisions are made and how we are structured to predictably deliver results creating value for our customers and shareholders the result aligns leadership and management on how we're gonna run this business and where accountability sits within the organ while simplifying our business and optimizing our cost structure there were many changes that were made to this process that will provide a bit of insight on a few examples we made a decision to move our center led parts business back to the business units there was an initial hypothesis that growth would be achieved by implementing a consolidated centralized parts business stemming from some in-market synergies that growth did not materialize our businesses inherently know our customers and products and have the institutional knowledge to answer questions and deliver results to our customers more efficiently further the realignment will create a five million annual structural cost savings combined outcome of reducing complexity for our customers the unrealized growth and what ended up being a duplicate cost structure during the decision to make this change this decision was a result of a careful examination of how to efficiently serve our customers and simplify our operations conversely there are a few aspects of our operating model where we move more firmly to single that operation and becoming an operating company these include development development of a single activities related to operational excellence and commercial excellence or scaling of capabilities and processes will yield value creation for our shareholders many of these capabilities been discussed by management previously but have liked the commitment and rigor to yield sustainable and improvements that create value we are focused on changing that and made investments and new personnel and technologies to to our operating model to build the disciplines necessary to to drive sustain improvement and performance as part of our operational excellence we are building capabilities to improve database decision making simplify operations and improve efficiencies on our balance sheet this includes discipline review and controls of corporate costs manufacturing overhead labor and direct materials it requires increased capabilities focused on engineering manufacturing operations supply chain and purchasing to accelerate the change process and created best in class operations we have made some changes there are a couple that i'd like to highlight today first we've expanded the role of our commercial president brian prairie to include the role of senior vice president of operations in this role brian brian leads our manufacturing execution operational excellence and supply chain brian is a master black belt in six sigma elaine since they and have the extensive background in manufacturing operations and purchasing making him the ideal person to build out our similar operational efforts his wealth position to take on this dual role while continuing to lead our commercial segment in addition we have hired rob dysloski our vice president and chief supply officer rob joins rev group having recently led honeywells and tell a greater global supply chain and with honeywell's corporate chief procurement officer as cpo at honeywell he managed an eighteen billion dollar annual spend portfolio as well as leading three thousand procurement global procurement specialist rob has a very broad on industrial background from aerospace automotive paint and coatings and it includes logistics he has had an executive leadership roles with xpo logistics valspar reynolds group in alcoa he rings the red group both the vision and the exit using capabilities to build the best class global sourcing organization we're looking for and purchasing supply chain organization combined with a sense of urgency to do this at a pace rob has only been in the position that we have for a few weeks but he's taken exhausted look at our infrastructure as quickly to identify the list of opportunities i'm very pleased to have rob join our team i look forward to the impact that he will have on our business performance in my nine months since joining rev there have been challenges some that we're expecting some that are unexpected we implemented much change during that time we began to see sequential improvements in our results we have much work remaining in the months ahead but i'm encouraged by the progress today i look forward to share more about the plans in the path forward with you during our analyst investor day that we're planning for april with that i'm not gonna turn over to mark for details in our fourth quarter segment performance mark thanks for adding in good morning everyone please turn the page for the slide deck as i review our segment level performance prior to emergency segment fourth quarter sales were three hundred thirty million a twenty three percent increase compared to prior year this includes approximately seventy five million of sales attributed to our acquisition of spartan er that occurred earlier in the year excluding spartan organic segment sales decrease six percent from the fourth quarter of last year while organic fire sales were relatively flat we shipped fewer ambulance units due to lingering impacts of covid although down from prior year north and and ambulance deliveries increase twenty one percent sequentially in order trends continue to remain strong as municipalities and federal stimulus dollars prioritize health and safety needs cares act stimulus dollars remain available for ambulance units delivered through the twenty twenty one calendar year end continuing an important driver demand for our f and e segment within the fire division throughput increased sequentially once again at our e one plant and on call florida unit production was up forty four percent year over year demonstrating the benefits of lean programs and operating disciplines that were deployed over the second half of the year bringing in lean expertise allowed a dual track of affecting immediate change while allowing time to develop leadership train internal resources and build a pipeline of opex project that will stay in continuous improvement we plan to follow this model of deploying lean assistance where we feel there will be an immediate impact while training our internal teams that all businesses through alina academy that is designed to deliver annual throughput and cost out targets fnes segment adjusted ebitda was fourteen point eight million in the fourth quarter twenty twenty compared to seven point four million in fourth quarter of twenty nineteen the increase was primarily due to the improvements in e one just mentioned in the acquisition of spartan er ambulance ebitda was relatively flat with the priority despite the decrease in sales due to product productivity improvements that increased margins most notably at our largest manufacturing location in orlando spartan contributed four million just at e b d a to the of any segment within the quarter which completes three quarters of integration that exceeded expectations the addition of this world class chassis manufacturing business provides the center of excellence that will be leveraged across our fire businesses and brands creating further opportunities for manufacturing efficiencies within the segment spartan is now integrated into the fne segment operationally and we do not plan to call out this individual contribution in the future total fne backlog was nine hundred sixty six million up sixteen percent year over year this includes backlog acquired from spartan and strong ambulance order intake throughout the fiscal year including the fourth quarter a decline in legacy fire back log is largely the result of increased throughput that the ocala plant and a decrease in fire industry unit orders that occurred from the onset to covid through approximately september of twenty twenty industry orders during that period declined over twenty five percent since that time and during the final two months of our fiscal twenty twenty our order rates improved to levels on power with fiscal year twenty nineteen fire backlog remains strong and now reflects competitive industry lead to and ambulance backlog is that a record high which provides a solid base for sales growth and conversion of earnings within the f and e segment we currently expect year over year f and e revenue improvement versus this year's softness related to covid f and tsm and inspection delays which occurred primarily in the second and third fiscal quarters at this time apps another recurrence of the virus or additional government restrictions we feel confident that we will convert to earnings more efficiently and with improved incremental agents turning the slide five commercial segment fourth quarter sales were ninety one million a decrease of fifty six million compared to the prior period which included approximately fifty seven million from the shuttle businesses invested in early twenty twenty your organic declined sales was related to lower sales at all businesses within the segment year over year school bus sales declined fourteen percent in the fourth quarter which is a significant improvement that the a quarter decline of thirty one percent and puts our fiscal second half twenty twenty sales ahead of reported declines and industry registrations for the same period municipal transit sales decreased forty percent for the prior year primarily due to delivery schedule adjustment to a large order to accommodate the needs of our customer that we disclosed in our fiscal third quarter the change extended the delivery timeline through fiscal twenty twenty one and there have been no further changes to that contract specialty markets remain depressed with sales down forty percent versus last year while this is an improvement from third quarter decline to fifty percent the sales were primarily existing stock units built to order canceled questions or delivery or delays that needed significant rework to meet customer specifications turning to segment adjusted ebitda for the commercial segment commercial segment adjusted ebitda six point four million with down sixty one percent first the prior year period which included one million ebitda related to vested shuttle bus businesses the decline in ebitda was primarily result of the sale decline in all businesses as well as the inefficiencies related to of the rework of stock units within the specialty division although the stock unit rework had a negative contribution to performance in the quarter given the severe and market declines in this business we took the opportunity to right size what had become an inflated stock unit in within the bus division despite revenue declines in both school and municipal markets these businesses were able to continue to flex production with demand and contribute high single digit ebitda margins commercial segment backlog at the end of the fourth quarter with two hundred seventy four million down fourteen percent versus the prior year quarter which contained eighty six million the shuttle bus backlog excluding shuttle bus and eighteen percent organic backlog increase is a is a result of an increase especially division orders within the fourth quarter and timing of a large municipal transit order that entered backlog in the first quarter this year partially offset by decreased school bus school by orders the increased specialty orders were for both terminal trucks and street sweepers and this quarter marks the best order intake since fiscal first quarter two thousand nineteen we have been aggressively pursuing new contracts and tools in these markets winning a large rental company contract for street sweepers and advancing in the bid process for terminal trucks at several national accounts last month we are excited to announce a partnership with high street le group to develop electric and hydrogen power terminal trucks to reduce emissions and increase efficiency and productivity we are targeting the end of our fiscal year to have the initial prototypes available for market testing with momentum moment item in our specialty markets a longer cycle municipal transit backlog we feel that commercial segment is in a position to grow revenue despite uncertainty surround the timing of a full time return to the classroom and impacts on school bus demand as covid nineteen vaccines become more widespread there is reason to be optimistic that decisions reopen schools and districts will benefit our peak spring selling season for school bus given the cost out activities that we took this year across all of our commercial segment businesses we expect increased volume and specialty and potentially school bus to convert at solid incremental margins we anticipate the overall variability of twenty twenty commercial segment bottom line margin performance will dissipate in twenty twenty one absent any new government directives that may impact end markets employer attendance or delivery acceptance the near term potential for this segment remains in the high single digit ebitda margin profile turning to pay to slide six recreation segment sales of a hundred ninety four million we're up twelve percent versus last year reflecting strong wholesale shipments and retail demand for class b classy and total units class a shipments were down mid single digits versus last year as production was limited by supply chain constraints primarily in gas units we feel the backlog and productive and production capacity are in place to support higher shipments once the bottlenecks clear despite shifting fewer class a units award-winning product introductions continue to take market share resulting in higher retail demand increased pricing and lower discounting allowances recreation segment e ebitda adjusted ebitda with twenty five million for the quarter and increase a twelve million or a hundred seventy five percent first prior year adjusted ebitda margin of ten point six percent it reflects uh i reflect the higher sales mix of non-class a products within the quarter as well as the impact of operating leverage and productivity improvements achieved across all categories with sequential and year over year or margin gains despite lower class a unit sales profitability increased over six hundred fifty basis points versus fourth quarter two thousand nineteen and for a business that had recently struggled to break even it was encouraging to see profitability reach levels to not attain over the past two years we expect to continue this momentum by driving efficient manufacturing practices and commercial activities focused on dealer wins and markets or gains that would deliver sustainable performance not only during this up turning demand but across all parts of demand and stocking cycles segment backlog increased two hundred twenty percent year over year to five hundred forty million which reflects strong order intake across all rv categories over the past six months the past two quarters were store highs were orders by a substantial margin and a current backlog is nearly double that of any point in rev's recreation segment history we feel this supports the current industry thinking that wholesale shipments will be up twenty percent the more in calendar twenty twenty one and at our product portfolio niche market placements and iconic brands lands us in a strong position to participate in that growth as we move forward we expect the sales mix of products to normalize of class a production and delivery schedules improve and therefore to expect segment margins in the mid single digits versus ten percent achieved in q4 on slide seven consolidated full year at sales declined five percent year over year to two point three billion in a challenging year that includes expansion of production activities at a recreation segment at the onset of covid and unplanned disruptions related to the pandemic at several other businesses adjusted a bit declined thirty four percent compared to fiscal twenty nineteen to sixty seven point five million nearly fifty million or three quarters of that total occurred in the second half of the year as revenue throughput and margins improved sequentially through period rod mentioned a number of restructuring activities related to right size in the organization this included decentralizing the parts business from the corporate center back into the individual businesses and sunsetting less profitable brands and dealer relationships with in the portfolio the total structural cost savings executed through our fiscal year end are expected to deliver a total of ten million annually turning to slide eight full year net cash provider by operating activities was fifty six million compared to fifty three million of net cash provided in a prior year period cash generated was primary rate to improvements in accounts receivable and inventory management as well as an increase in customer deposits receive we will continue to work all aspects of network and capital including reinforcing the disciplines needed to reach optimal inventory levels balancing accounts receivable and payable terms and aligning more of our businesses with a model that collects a greater amount into customer deposits networking capital at october thirty first twenty twenty with three hundred fifty five million compared to three hundred seventy three million at the end of fiscal twenty nineteen net debt as of october thirty first was three hundred thirty one million including eleven million cash on hand versus three hundred seventy seven million at the end of fiscal twenty nineteen at fiscal year hand the company maintained apple liquidity with two hundred eighty three million available under our abl revolving credit facility we may recall that our term loan amendment effective in april of last year reverts to a net leverage ratio of five point two five times with certain addbacks related to spartan acquisition in the fiscal first quarter of twenty twenty we are confident that we will attain this target you may also recall that a term loan expires in april twenty twenty two we will be working with our banking partners throughout the upcoming months to optimize our capital structure we do not plan to issue guidance today do the recent recurrence of covid nineteen cases globally within our business across the country the safety of our employees remains the top priority contact tracing testing and measures to prevent the spread of the virus come with uncertain staffing levels that impact our businesses and supply chain partners the cdc has issued and continues to update new directives that we follow under these conditions our customer's ability to travel inspect vehicles first updance creates uncertainty of delivery and revenue recognition timing until we can reasonably predict the potential impacts of these changes we feel it would not be prudent to give a range of estimates however with the emergence of vaccines we hope to a better clarity when we host our virtual investor and analyst day in april at rod referenced please save the date on april fifteenth when we plan to provide a deeper look at our business and operating model and provide immediate term targets if we feel that the operating landscape has become more predictable we expect to also provide full year guidance we will extend a formal invitation to this event soon with that i'll turn it back over to rod so i guess uh just a few was in comments then yeah so um you know the fiscal year twenty twenty has been a challenging for the rev group and our employees in many regards we have gone through a number of internal changes as we've moved towards the future we sold a business purchased and integrated a business to in the time in which the external environment as you all know has been very often unpredictable i'm i'm pleased with the progress we've achieved in a short amount of time given the amount of change we have experienced our business continue to have relatively healthy backlogs and we believe they support revenue growth in the upcoming year most importantly uh i'm very pleased with what our employees have done every day they they they put themselves in the situation where they've delivered on them and they can deliver on our commitments and deliver to our customers understand very adverse circumstances as we look to support the first responders in our country so i'm very pleased i want to thank them publicly for what they've done and with that i think we'll hold it over and have have a q and a with an open mic so question they interesting thank you if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone key pad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue and for participant choosing speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star fees please ask one question and one followup question and then review for additional questions our first question is from <unk> with goldman sachs please proceed yes hi uh good morning everyone and uh congratulations and a really strong performance here hey jerry thanks uh thank you um uh what really uh stood out with the margin performance in the rv business and you alluded to uh mix helping uh i'm wondering if we just step through you know looking at the year over year margin expansion much of that was improved productivity how much of that was pricing makes and can we think about the mix uh tailwind as being sustainable from here yeah jerry as i said in uh in uh the um my my prepared remarks you know the mix really helps us and i think we've always that that you know outside of class a those are double digit performing businesses so when you look at the mix there our mix was um down on class a and um we really had two things helping us from a tail one perspective the fact that uh had a larger mix in those more profitable business of being the class b c's and tables and class a actually had a high concentration of diesel product within the quarter which is more profitable than the gas product so so even though we say covid um a lot of the furniture issues we've had that we talked about previously were on our gas unit lines and so even within class a we had a margin pickup from the concentration of diesel within the quarter which we would expect to more flatten out to a reasonable normalized going forward and of course as class a continues to develop it'll get more to the forty sixty sort of split that we traditionally have seen within that group so it really is just a matter of the amount that we sold within those other products categories plus the mixed benefit and of course as you saw within the rv itself the productivity improvements that they had drove a you know significant part of that six hundred fifty basis point improvement their sales that we sell sure go ahead sorry please go ahead yeah i was saying the sales actually down here on here right so they actually were able to deliver a profit this quarter versus last so that was majority of that benefit was from productivity okay and and then firing emergency in nine fifty <unk> um turn the corner uh can you talk about how uh the production rates um have continued into december have you continued to ramp higher or was it forty percent it increase essentially gets you to the normalized run rate and when do we see from an accounting standpoint the lower per unit costs flowing through to the full expect well i do think this is right we have made considerable progress in in that location uh but there's still opportunity for us to even do much better there so we as mark mentioned in his early discussion and we've gotten back to more of a standard industry lead times we continue to work on throughput on both arrows and pumpers and that plant uh and we believe there's opportunities to continue margin expansion through productivity so while we're we're pleased with the path we're on and and we're seeing this thing move and get be able to get look at our backlog get to what we think is a more of a standard lead time uh we we still there's opportunity to improve our efficiencies in that plant and get a market and get margin expansion in that business so that's just work in front of us so thank you yeah thanks sir our next question is from jamie cook with credits please proceed hi good morning um i guess a couple questions one i think you noted on the commercial side you expected to seek growth here every year just a clarification i'm assuming that's you know normalize for the divest share so look at sort of the ninety million quarterly run rate when you're talking about growth um and i guess just my second question can you just give more color um obviously the outlook on the on the bus side or the school bus side is is is somewhat uh you know uncertain um as you talk to customers can you just talk about how they're thinking about buying trends in the latter part of the year what would be the major drivers what would they need to see to come back in the market and just sort of you know the overall age of the fleet thanks well i i think that you know this is right i you know the feedback we have from from in markets or from other partners is that you know the whole thing in certainly around school openings or schools the are open staying opening that that's the that's the driving factor and and right now there's just tremendous uncertainty around that is the back half of this year is going to shape out differently obviously with the emergency of the multiple vaccines and and i think what's a real draw i've for uh for people to get back in school from the public i think that's that's pretty clear that people want to go back to school that that's makes promise we've got a couple things there i think the detail winds to help us get where we need to be but we're gonna know i think by the time we get to get together in april we're gonna know how that shapes out but right now there's just too much uncertainty for us to look forward and project what that school bus market's gonna look like not knowing what the impacts of covid is gonna be until we see the success rate on this virus and what that looks like and and then and then further moving into the you know the you know the spring when our you know we typically see april may being when we start getting significant orders and delivery so that'll be a timeframe we're gonna know but right now it's it's it's not clear it's just a tremendous sense certainly everybody's kind of awaiting uh that that that time period so sorry and then just the the commentary on revenues for commercial is assuming it excludes the developers to look at the ninety million quarterly run rate correct and then my last question how to think about the corporate um expense line you know as as we look to twenty twenty one any color there thanks yeah so you're right on the commercial exactly right excluding the ninety million and then uh on the um the the corporate of course parts was part of the centralized so that five million drops right to the corporate line so you could see that five million drop that's where that was traditionally shown to centralized parts business okay great thank you yeah thank you our next question is from courtney <unk> with morgan stanley please proceed hi thanks good morning guys good morning courtney back on the a comment uh you know appreciate that there will be a mixed shift in recreation next year i think you said you expect you know in line with the industry wholesale uh shipments up about twenty percent but i think you had said that you were expecting mid-single digit margins and i think we've historically been seen more high single digit out of that segment so um just wanted to make sure i fully understood um what what you were thinking the mix shift impact uh would have on twenty twenty one over the course of the week for some time now yeah we've we've truly seen mid single digits so you know what we determine as mid right five to five to seven percent so that's probably in line what we've historically done but the mix shift really is what i refer to uh what jerry's question is um again uh at forty percent of our sales being in the rv or our class a business you know those as you know are depressed margin so those bring down the ones that are a double digit from a run rate perspective so it's really the fact that our v uh our um what we call our b our class a was actually down from a mix so as they come more to the forty to fifty percent range they were forty percent in the quarter versus fifty percent in the priority year so you had a ten percent drop there from a mixed perspective and so it's really that that simple as far as looking at the other three business that we have in that portfolio at double digit and bringing in uh a lower single digit um mix from the class a will actually depress those ten percent down to the more of the five to seven percent range okay that's helpful um and then any more um specificity you could give us just on commercial and ethic yeah that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's gonna be dependent on your delivery schedule but any high level thoughts on the margin side yeah i think we said high single digits on the uh um from the whole commercial side but obviously on the capacity if you're talking about capacity that's um you know that's one we're still with the backlog here so as i said my prepared to marks we took the opportunity to a lot of the units that we had uh um developed coming into the uh what our normal selling season didn't uh uh develop but exiting the quarter we were very happy with some of the progress we made and our backlog is now performing so we should see the variability uh get out of there but when you look at the total commercial segment we would expect the high single sort of what we were expecting coming in a quarter if we wouldn't have had the issues that we experienced on the commercial side and liquidation that we did on some of those stock units so we had expected to get more like we guided to last time more of the mid or the high single digits for the commercial segment okay gotcha and then i guess just lastly um you know you mentioned you know concerns about delivery schedules for next year but if you had to just highlight you know what are the three categories that has the most uh variability or you're most concerned about versus the ones that are um or that you feel most confident in the delivery schedules for next year just so we can get a sense of where the real risk is by by categories you mean the business units or the product categories uh i guess yeah i guess i just meant you know the within the business unit you know obviously your recreation that club is is you know pretty strong so do you feel like that's you know where you have the most certainty you know versus um some of the product lines in in ethnic and commercial i think that you know the and i'll comment and mark and clean up what i say i think that when you think about in markets that are affected did by the the issues i think primarily obviously in market demand in the uh in the school bus businesses is the issue all the businesses are subject to some level of supplier issues that we're dealing with i think rv is probably the one that we've seen the most stock out which is pretty consistent across the industry um the other element that we deal with a little bit which is a timing issue not a uh impact probably within the fiscal year is just the inspections that have to take place in ambulance and fire around getting a bus off the lot or or sorry a truck or an ambulance off the lot related to completing final inspections by getting people to the side that's a real issue that we we've been dealing with in terms of um you know revenue recognition cause that has to happen in order for us to to convert the bus so i think you know in in in school bus it certainly is um it's it's in market demand there's some supplier issues that are spread throughout that we've been able to overcome for the most part but they are they they do pop up and and and we have to work through that uh and then and then the last thing would be the businesses that are subject to inspections which is you know your your your emergency segment is where we see that at mark i dunno if you wanna add anything i think that's right i think as we said previously one of the things that we thought would happen here with covid as people converted like people working from home we expected that more people would adopt virtual inspections for our ambulance and fire trucks and as exiting covid our customers have come back to wanting to see their trucks in person and we as research resurgence here we're hoping that they'll go back to virtual but we have shifted back to wanting to do in-person inspections so we haven't seen them going back to virtual so obviously there is some flux there if people would go back to virtual inspections depending on what happens with the covid environment but we are back to our traditional as rob referred to actually seeing the units before they leave the yards so that we can revenue them and that's really the delays that i was speaking to of it's really our customers coming and inspecting the units and approving them for shipment great thanks as a reminder to star one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question our next question it's from roger patel with jeffrey please proceed hey thanks for taking the question um quick one on f and e margins um what's the anticipated f and e margin expansion once all the uh production and efficiencies are sorted out um what do you think the new margin profile looks like in a new normal yeah uh from a fire perspective obviously as <unk> as rein rated multiple times we're still in the multiple inning journey here so as he's referred to on the e one um we still have a lot of work to do we're seeing progression but um of course we have other facilities within the portfolio too that we're gonna address as extending my prepared mark so we're still expecting to be in the double digits at the end of this journey but we're still working through that right so of course we're not given guidance here but again it's still in a multiple year perspective to get to that ten so we're just um happy to see the progression here that we've seen throughout the quarter and obviously uh our our forward looking uh will provide more guidance uh in uh in april yeah i think there's there's you know when you think about operate some improvements and and and how you walk down that what mark refer to as a multi intern when you come into the role you there's there's some quick things you can do to get pop and and again improvement and then it's about building capabilities and i mentioned from an operational excellence standpoint you know it's gaining up the lean capabilities and and and center led top activities that get implemented in the plants around uh ci around purchasing uh building engineering capabilities to get design costs through v a v e uh those are things that that you you just for capability building but the good thing is that it's a continual improvement continuing improvement process where you're gonna be getting at that every day by building pipelines to go execute again so we're in the process right now coming out of our operating model discussion of standing up the capabilities and building out those teams and doing the certifications that mark talked about through lean that are gonna yield benefit to us for a very very long time things that did did not exist now we're we're standing up those capabilities and bringing on rob to lead our purchasing organization and get the focus on that significant spend uh i think it's gonna yield great benefit to us too so those will all contribute to a margin expansion story not only in emergency but across the business and so that's uh but it does take work to stand it up but it starts with organizing aligning and then investing in those capability building and then driving it through process rigor each each each day each week each month that's helpful thank you our next question is from <unk> with <unk> please proceed thanks uh morning guys um uh okay one more question on on uh a quick question on chassis um is as you're looking at your core in production planning based on your backlog are there any portions of your business where you're getting a sense that you're having either challenges obtaining chassis or uh the the delivery timelines are extended um and look i mean i'm thinking specifically a on ambulances and and some of the stuff the recreation as well like you know class b's and so on yeah no mega i'm glad to say and uh we we're not experiencing those in fact um you know we've we've had a pretty good supply chain from that perspective so i was happy this quarter not to be talking about chassis uh shortages for once uh even though it's only my second one so i know you've heard that consistently so we've been very happy with that in fact uh you know in the rb side especially we um you know we took advantage of what the uh our run rates were gonna be and actually ordered ahead so we're actually um um sitting with plenty of chassis from that perspective in that business and then on the ambulance side we haven't had any uh issues from a chassis perspective and we've been getting our appropriate allocations from our oe partners okay uh that's helpful and then maybe my follow-up um sort of sticking with the this theme how do you think about steel prices and raw material um inflation in twenty twenty one um what are some of the steps that you're taking to mitigate this because um obviously historically um this has been a area where we're we've seen some trouble in prior years thank you yeah so i mean obviously on the parts of our business which large part of businesses build out a backlog of you know there there's always the the issue you're trying to upset inflation with your your efficiency efforts because you you've your purchased process established on a backlog-based business so we're managing that obviously a big part of what rob's uh efforts is gonna be is to look at new purchasing to be able to offset offset that within a fiscal fiscal years we can cycle through and get the margins that we need on a price cost basis but uh so it's it's a lot around driving efficiency to make sure that that we're doing everything you can to optimize our cost structure to to have any leak that does come through inflation into a backlog based business we can offset through other other means and mark 'em up you wanna add anything to that or no i think that's right and that's one of the things that i'm working personally with rob on make sure we understand those inflationary factors as we go through twenty twenty one as well as our agreements with our supply base that's one of the things that the robs can acclimated to and we are there's actually a heightened focus uh in those businesses where we don't have the longer backlogs we've obviously come out with some price increases as our competitors have so we're managing that with the uh supply base as well as our our customers i do think one of the things you know one of the things we're working on is is trying to get in front of how we think about price price as a function of inflation and to make sure when you think about a price increase or setting a price and the market that you're thinking about the build cycle of when that that vehicle will get built so you reflect some inflationary characteristics in your costing and the business most of our businesses have done that to some degree but that's something i think that we gotta get great around cause when you're working on a backlog based business and you're doing uh selling ford projection on deliveries you gotta be thinking about the inflationary times that you're in and making sure that you're you're costing that vehicle to such that uh by the time you're doing the bill or you're you're shipping the vehicle that you've anticipated any inflationary costs in your pricing costs uh absolutely i i understand that i guess i'm just wondering based on what you know today uh do you believe you're gonna you're gonna be in a position where you can be neutral from a price cost standpoint going forward or should we try to bake in some kind of a headline thank you yeah i think based on the data that we have now relative to price costs the efficiency efforts that we've got in the business should yield was a a minimum neutrality in our performance going forward in the in the fiscal year appreciate it good luck guys thanks as a reminder to start one on your telephone keypad if you would like to ask a question we will pause for a brief moment to pull for a final question there are no more questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back
