good morning to everyone joining us on the call today as we go over our results for the third quarter of two thousand twenty providing up of our strategic outlook and give some additional color on our operations the new home company made significant progress on a series of strategic initiatives and generated a profit in the third quarter of two thousand twenty we experienced healthy expansion to our home building gross margin while continuing to emphasize overhead cost containment thanks to several operational improvements in a very strong housing rebound we do integrated two hundred and fifty one net new orders in the quarter representing a hundred and two percent increase as compared to last year mainly as a result of a seventy five percent improvement in our sales pace which came in at three point five homes per community per month order activity improved as a quarter progressed and we have seen demand trends stay above normal seasonal level since the quarter ended the new home market is benefiting from several positive factors including record low interest rates the scarcity of existing home inventory and a noticeable shift in attitudes towards home ownership some of this shift can be attributed to the ongoing pandemic which has made many americans rethink how and where they live given all the ways the virus is impacting our lives but an equally important factor driving the move to home ownership has been the emergence of the millennial age cohort as a buyer demographic this sizable age group was slower to enter the housing market relative to earlier generations due to a number of factors but we are now seeing millennials make up an increasingly large share of the buyer population this demographic shift was occurring well before the pandemic started and we believe it will be a driving force for our in this well after the pandemic and while the positive fundamental backdrop for our industry has been a nice tailwind for our business we believe our strong order activity this quarter was also the result of our expansion to more affordable price points over the last few years we have been transitioning much of our portfolio away from high asp communities and into the more affordable segments of the market the goal is to take our premium brand experience that is centered around industry leading customer service best in class quality and innovative design and make it more accessible through efficient for our plans and higher density projects this focus has served this well in recent quarters and dovetails nicely with the millennial demographic trends i just mentioned order activity in our newly open to affordable communities has outpaced our legacy higher price communities by a wide margin and we are seeing better prices and margin trends at these lower price communities as well this pricing for hour has been a key ingredient in making headway with one of our main initiatives for the year gross margin expansion over the past several quarters our margins have been depressed due to our focus on generating cash showing up the balance sheet and turning through higher price legacy communities now that we are in a much better position from both a financial and product standpoint we have an opportunity to show real improvement on the gross margin front we posted a three hundred and twenty basis point year over year increase to our home building gross margin in the third quarter excluding impairments in the prior year and we feel we can push margins higher over time through steady price increases better product mix and cost containment while this margin progression will fluctuate depending on the mix of pros we believe the longterm trajectory is headed in the right direction with a healthy demand outlook a great product profile rising margins and a much improved balance sheet the new home company is in a great position to end the year on a strong no and carry that momentum into the new year with that i'd like to turn the call over to leonard who will provide more detail on our operations thanks larry and good morning to everyone joining us on the call today we experienced a widespread acceleration demand in the third quarter driven by low mortgage rates limited existing home supply a desire from buyers to move to less densely pop areas and the surge of millennial buyers that larry mentioned the demand was broad base both from a price point and geographic standpoint which allowed us to push pricing it nearly all of our communities during the quarter traffic conversion rates are at all time highs as buyers feel a sense of urgency to move forward with a purchase decision given the lack of available supply and low interest rates as a result our homes and backlog increased at three hundred twenty nine which represented a fifty nine percent year over year improvement and the quarter looking ahead we expect order activity you remain above normal seasonal trends in the near term but our focus has shifted slightly given the size of our backlog and our desire to increase margins we wanna make sure our sales don't get too far out in front of our starts while also maximizing the profit from each new home sale to that end we have delayed some sales releases in an effort to align our sales with construction starts and implement additional price increases while this we moderate our sales pace from the levels we have experienced recently we believe this is a prudent way to manage our backlog and improve our margins in terms of cost number recently hit an all-time high driven by diminished capacities tariffs uncertainty of covid on workers in the mills and a rapid increase in sales and starts fortunately we have started to see the number pricing come down from its highs and hope this trend continues outside of lumber our material cost of remain relatively flat with respect to our markets arizona continues to be the standout performer for us averaging four point one sales per community per month the strong absorption was driven by seven new communities we've recently opened over the past five months which have also generated gross margins meaningfully higher than the company average our mayor post a mini master plan consisting of three product segments open the last week of september and sold eighteen homes during the quarter while our mosaic mini master plan continues to experience solid sales as well we will deliver our first homes from our affordably price communities in arizona in the fourth quarter and we expect these communities to contribute significantly to the companies per up in two thousand twenty one arizona still remains our most challenge market when it comes to labor and sub trade availability and we have seen a linking of our cycle times by a few weeks as a result we are working hard to overcome these issues and believe arizona will be a key contributor to our company success moving forward the market dynamics in california as a whole feel the best that they've been doing in the current housing cycle order paces continue to run at high levels and we are seeing cycle times stay relatively consistent in southern california our communities average a sales pace of three point one per month during the quarter demand was particularly strong in the core areas of the inland empire where we can offer our premium brand experience at lower price points we've targeted this region as a key component of our expansion into more affordable product and we anticipate opening five affordably price communities within the inland empire over the next eighteen months in northern california our communities average three point six sales per month for the quarter with strength across the board affordability remains an issue for most buyers in the core bay area and we've limited our exposure to this market as we have nearly closed out at our remain any community in <unk> we continue to see a migration from the bay area into the more affordable areas in and around sacramento our four communities in <unk> california have benefited significantly from this migration and as our monthly sales absorption pace was four point four homes per community during the two thousand twenty third quarter as we continue to make changes to improve our probability we believe there is potential in our fee building business and are currently sourcing new opportunities during the third quarter we started construction on the model complex at atlas our fee building community for five point at the great point in irvine and expect to open for sales in early two thousand twenty one this arrangement is different than most of the traditional fee building arrangements we've had in the past as the new home company will also brand market and sell these homes we are currently in discussions with other land owners to build for cell housing and single family rental housing on a fee basis these future opportunities will help partially offset at a near term reduction in fee building revenues resulting from irvine pacific decision to manage their construction of their home building operations on their own and phase out our fee building arrangement with them as a result we expect our fee building revenues to decline over the next year and then increase in two thousand twenty two as new opportunities start generating fee revenue and profits we are excited for these new opportunities and believe they can generate meaningful income in the future using nominal capital in summary we continue to benefit from extremely strong housing fundamentals in all of our markets and are recently open communities have been well received we are working hard to take advantage of the demand strength we are seen with targeted price increases in an effort to improve our profitability we make good strides on this front and third quarter and expect to make further progress in the future now i'd like to turn it over to john for more detail on our financial results this quarter thank you leonard and good morning for the two thousand twenty third quarter we generated pret income of one point five million dollars compared to four point eight million dollars pretext loss and the year ago period the two thousand nineteen third quarter included a total of three point six million of inventory impairment charges and one point five million dollar loss on on a land sale in the prior year third quarter net income for the quarter was one point two million or six cents per diluted shares compared to a net loss of four point six million for twenty three cents per diluted share in the prior year period our home sales revenue for the third quarter was a hundred seventeen point four million compared to a hundred eighteen point eight million in the prior year period disliked increase compared to the prior was attributable to a twenty two percent decrease in average selling price to seven hundred forty eight thousand dollars resulting from our continued expansion into lower price points which was partially offset by twenty seven percent increase in deliveries we estimate two thousand twenty fourth quarter home sales revenue to be between a hundred fifteen and a hundred and twenty five million and our average selling price for the fourth quarter to be approximately seven hundred twenty thousand dollars our gross margin for the two thousand twenty third quarter was fourteen point two percent versus nine point five percent in the prior year period and exceeded the top end of our previously issue guidance the two thousand nineteen third quarter gross margin excluding impairments of one point seven million was eleven percent the three hundred twenty basis point improvement in gross margin excluding the prior year impairments was primarily you to a product mix shift to more affordable product which generally have higher gross margins and to a lesser extent fewer deliveries from lower margin move up condominium communities compared to the two thousand nineteen third quarter these positive factors were partially offset by sixty basis point increase in capitalized interest included in cost of sales due to the mix of homes delivered during the quarter excluding interest in cost of sales and impairments are just a gross margin from home sales was twenty percent as compared to sixteen point two percent in the year ago period for the two thousand twenty fourth quarter we estimate our gross margin to be between thirteen point eight and fourteen point two percent our sgna rate as a percentage of home sales revenue for the third quarter was twelve point three percent versus eleven point one percent and a year ago period the higher sgna rate in two thousand twenty was primarily the result of higher commissions incentive compensation and professional fees and to a lesser extent a three hundred thousand dollars reduction in gena expenses allocated to fee building cost of sales for the two thousand twenty fourth quarter we estimate our sgna rate to be between twelve point four and twelve point eight percent the higher projected sgna rate relative to q3 is partially the result of a lower anticipated allocate should have gna expenses to the fee business due to lower anticipated fee revenue in q4 due to the irvine pacific wine down we opened four new communities in arizona during the quarter and end of the quarter with twenty five active communities which was a fourteen percent increase compared to the prior third quarter we have one new community that opened in october and expect to sell out of approximately three communities before the end of the year you building revenue for the twenty twenty third quarter was thirteen point four million compared to twenty two point three million in the prior year period people living gross margin for the two thousand twenty third quarter was two hundred sixty eight thousand and compared to six hundred forty seven thousand in the prior year period the reduction in fee building gross margin was primarily due to lower fee building activity in irvine california for the two thousand twenty fourth quarter we estimate our fee building red to be between five and eight million dollars we continue to wind down our joint ventures during the quarter we finalize the sale of our interest in the bedford land development joint venture and delivered the final homes at our mckinley home building joint venture in sacramento california of the companies three remaining active joint ventures we have seven homes remaining to deliver at the mountain shadows home building joint venture in arizona three home sites to sell it our davis and development joint venture in northern california and we continue to actively pursue an exit from the russell ranch land development joint venture in folsom california during the third quarter we generated forty million in operating cash flow and reduce our net debt to capital ratio to forty five point one percent a nine hundred eighty basis point improvement compared to the year ago period and the lowest level since december two thousand seventeen we ended the quarter with a hundred twenty six million dollars in cash and cash equivalence and had no borrowings outstanding under our sixty million dollar revolving credit facility we also purchased five point two million in principal of our senior notes due two thousand twenty two at a discount we further strengthen our balance sheet by extending our debt maturity profile subsequent to the quarter end in october we issued two hundred fifty million of new seven and a quarter percent senior notes due october two thousand twenty five to refinance our existing senior notes due april two thousand twenty two in connection with this refinance we estimate a one time pretext charge of approximately eight million to be recorded in the four quarter we also entered into a new sixty million senior and secured revolving credit facility on october thirtieth that has a maturity date of april thirtieth two thousand twenty three at one and a half years extension from the previous bank credit facility the extension of these debt materials will allow us to make longterm investments as we replenish our land portfolio and position the company for longterm success lastly we spent fourteen million dollars on land and land deposits during the quarter we plan on increasing our land spend in the near future but remain focused on maintaining a proper balance between building liquidity managing leverage and rebuilding our land pipeline i'll turn the call back to larry for his concluding remarks thanks john we've been working hard as a company to make progress on a number of fronts this year and our results for the third quarter demonstrate that we have made signal and headway we improve our profitability by expanding our gross margins and further diversified our operations by continuing to close out legacy high price communities and open more affordable faster selling communities we also strengthen their balance sheet by generating strong cash flow from operations reducing our net leverage and extending our debt maturity profile these achievements have put us on more stable footing and give us a clear path to better results in the future i wanna thank all of our team members for how they've performed during these difficult times handling significant increase in business even experience would be challenging enough during normal times let alone in the middle of a pandemic and i'm really appreciative of your efforts that concludes our prepared remarks and now we'd be happy to take your questions thank you at this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session if you'd like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will end state your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants you can speak your equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star key our first question comes from the line of allen ra <unk> associates please proceed with your question hey guys good morning uh congress in all the progress are in the quarter and the strong results um first first question um maybe start off on the pricing side um while we're hundred so um sounds like you guys have had some success pushing price in the quarter and obviously the uh the longer term margin goal is is uh you know certainly i think looking a lot stronger now given the pricing environment but i'm curious uh if you could maybe just talk a little bit in and quantify maybe the level of price increases you guys have pushed through in the last couple of months and and um i'm curious if uh if you've seen any pushback to any of those price increases at this point uh i guess here in early november um assuming some of those price increases have been more recent leonard why don't you take it one thanks larry um thanks allen and good morning yeah i would say across the quarter you know we've continued to push pro seen at all of our communities we we literally raised prices at a hundred percent of our communities and on average um the average price increase was a little over four percent um you know there's kind of age quality by community second home communities at the lower end and then at the higher end are really some of our suburban communities we've continued to price it uh push those prices all through the quarter and really we haven't seen the resistance yet at today um and and continue to look for every opportunity we can to grow margins that's great to hear um second question uh you know you mentioned and this is a similar message we've heard from other builders just about the need to you know kind of slow things down a little bit not get backlogs too far expended and i think that makes a lot of sense although you know for you guys you're in a little bit of a different situation in that you know you're growing off of an admittedly fairly you know small level of activity so i was a little little bit surprised that you know you wouldn't be in a position where you could kind of let things run a bit hotter here and i'm curious if you could talk a little bit maybe rank order the constraints that you're seeing that would prevent you from from letting that go go hotter for a longer period of time in terms of your absorption right is it is a land issue i know your lot count has been trending uh you know quite a bit lower in the more recent quarters or is it more difficulty sourcing labor you know perhaps um you know the scale benefits that some of the larger builders have is that the working as a disadvantage to you guys and trying to get labor in this tight environment right now yeah it's better again what i probably the latter of the two is driving it more or less allen it like in a perfect world you'd sell one home for and start four homes per month and really that's what our trade partners are set up for and we've kind of prepared them for that they've made the commitment to deliver that so you know we just wanna make sure again that our sold and unstarted backlog that don't get too far out front especially in an environment of rising prices we know that future land prices lands gonna cost more in the future and so really it's the capacity of our trade partners so we continue to measure that um we've on a little bit lighter on sales releases for that reason and uh we think that's the best course of action and like if i could add um i really do think it varies by market and also by uh newer housing program or older housing program so it isn't just a one size fits all leonard and john have worked pretty carefully of trying to analyze where we have opportunities and where um and and where there's more challenges and in some cases you know our goal is to build out of older projects and get through it but in other cases if we're not gonna be able to start a house we two or three months uh it doesn't make any sense that to put it up for sale in a market that continues to be strong and so you know i i actually think we're being very logical and we're attempting uh to maximize the profits and and if you look at the communities we've opened in the last twelve months you'd see a significant increase in both uh absorption and margin uh and and this we're hoping that we're gonna be able to keep that the absorption steady and the margins are improving there's no reason why we shouldn't be able to great i i appreciate that extra color there larry and if i can this sneak in one more here um you kind of brought up the land market a little bit um you know what are you seeing right now cause you know now the the debt refinancing behind you guys you obviously have a little bit more runway and visibility from the balance sheet perspective so i would imagine you know you you're kind of stepping on the gas a little bit here on the land side of things and at the same time i would imagine you know your competitors are as well given how strong selling environment has been so what's the availability of you know some of those quicker turn deals that you could kind of put you know kind of paper two and then potentially get on the ground here over the next twelve or eighteen months well it's it is oh go ahead let me just start leonard and then you jump through um you know let and in the markets we're in has always been challenging always and uh one of the strengths of our organization has been that we have land relationships to go back over thirty years uh whether with master developers or with individuals um and and it is tougher now but we're we are continuing to find opportunities and uh uh there is no reason why um we won't be able to you know grow the business over the next two to three years but one thing you have to be aware of in our investors i hope they all understand is that when california is your strongest marketplace uh it takes a couple years to from when you buy a piece of ground to when you're closing houses and we've been planning that and we understand that that's a situation we're in but uh don't lose track that if anything when the market is particularly tough or difficult because of uh a lot of competition relationships matter more than ever and that's one thing that we have and we always have and we always will have um and with with that leonard please um keep going yeah i think you hit most of the points larry i would say allen were certainly back in the market and we are kind of book ending this we're looking for opportunities that we can basically get control of that we can open a model home within twelve eighteen months and then we're because of somewhat limited capital we're looking were opportunities to fill our twenty three twenty four pipeline and those the profile those deals would look quite differently that land com uh com market is completely is really competitive right now as you would expect we've had some success tying up some interesting opportunities and i would say arizona is the most competitive land environment today and so that's probably our biggest challenge is to identify assets that make sense there's there's positions available but we wanna make sure they make sense and that we can deliver on those returns i'd add one other thing to your prior question real quick um when you talked about kind of sales pace and running it a little bit hotter i will say even with the steps that we've taken and you know we just closed the month of october october was a really strong month even with those measures it's the third strong strongest sales month in the company's history where sales are up sixty five percent um and we average average absorption of three point five and that's even counting closeout communities where we have two three four homes left to sell to kind of weight that down a little bit so again it's still an extremely strong market and we're kind of really excited about the future and what it can be for the company great thanks a lot guys and sounds promising and good luck thanks thanks so thank you thank you leave this in gentleman as a reminder if you'd like to join the question two please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from the line of alex parent with housing research center please proceed with your question morning guys great job thanks alex thanks um i was curious um you mentioned you're starting to do some fee work for five points do you have any sense of timing you can share with those windows first uh deliveries or revenues well i this is more uh probably you get your book earnings right uh when construction happens so can you kind of give us an idea of how to model that sure this is good morning alex this is leonard yeah so i'm sure are where it's a slightly different fee structure than say what we've done with irvine company in the past and so in this case we take on all of the normal builder responsibilities in the community will be branded under the new home name we sell and market the homes construct them and then take the back end service as well so the community will open during the first quarter and open for sales so that's when you know we will go to sale and then within the next two to three months we should see first closing so the way the fee structure works is we get a portion of the fee through the life of the project and then we get a backend portion of the fee at the close of the home so you know even today we'd be recognized very you know a small amount of fee but the significant fee would start coming in probably the end of q1 early q2 we're also really excited i think it was noted in the release that over the last six months we've been approached on several different fronts from it for some pretty exciting the opportunities including the single family rental business where we're talking to folks in arizona and we have a really exciting opportunity here in california to build up to thirteen fourteen hundred homes so we think it can drive a significant part of our business help us grow earnings well not having to put any form of significant capital into the business okay great and then on the joint venture side uh i noticed there's very few lots left is that basically winding down or will you will that stay alive i guess in two three years alex is john stevens uh yeah we we are sort of winding out the joint venture business uh we've got like i said on the call only a few lots left in our davis county project in northern california we have about i think seven homes left to deliver out of our mountain shadows community uh and then really the remaining lots are at our full some ranch deal up in northern california called russell ranch and we're in the process of exiting that partnership right now and i would say in the near term we really don't have any plans to enter into into any new joint ventures at this time but you know it's possible if the right opportunity came along that we would entertain that but for now that part of the business was really winding down okay great and then on the fact that one more on the uh mute that that you guys just raised um is the plans to pay off the twenty twenty two short term or closer you know to yeah it's already done that they can do yeah we affected that uh last week we closed on the bonds i believe it was on the twenty eighth of october and all the previous twenty two notes have been extinguished um and uh so that's done and then we use some of the cash some of our cash on hand um to pay off the balance cuz we raised two hundred fifty million of new notes and we had about roughly two hundred ninety two million of principal in the old notes so okay great i'll i'll get back to the cube good job sure thanks thank you our next question comes from the line of jason signage with uh private investor please proceed with your question thanks for taking my question guys and congratulations on the strong quarter uh my question really just kind of pertains to the priorities for capital deployment going forward uh you mentioned how you successfully if you leverage the balance sheet and extended all maturities um and the outlook for the business seems exceptionally strong um and you guys are significantly generating cash flow uh but with your stock trading at half a book value or basically half a tangible book of value um it's hard to really imagine there's a better use of cash right now we're partly used to cash right now then find back your own stuff so really what are your thoughts on potential share approaches and really how can we focus and think about priorities the capital deployment going forward that's a good question jason thank you um yeah you know we've we've looked at all aspects of use of our capital and we've and very focused as you mentioned on really leveraging the business and refinancing our bonds and pushing out the revolver extension which was a was a big important thing that we we completed on friday um so it really pushed us in a position now where we can reinvent in the business you know obviously we we did buy quite a few shares in the front half of the year when we saw stock price press very significantly and and i agree with you at trading at half half of multiple book value isn't uh where we'd like to be um but on the on the other hand we do need to uh reinvest in our business a little bit and we will evaluate really all aspects and we'll allocate the capital going forward we do have a little bit left on our authorizations from our board i think it was about one point seven million left authorized currently um but again we've been on pause on the land act side for a little bit now and and um we will sort of layer some of that in going forward um again we do need to sort of balance our capital allocation and it's a fair question but we we do need to reinvest in the business too so we'll continue to evaluate on all fronts moving forward uh john do you also wanna um address the you know idea where we are with leverage where we came from and where you see us moving to the future yeah i mean i i think our our net debt caps come down significantly at forty five percent forty five point one percent at the end of the quarter um you know it's down almost a thousand basis points where where we were a year ago um we will as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we will have a charge from the refinance of the old bonds which will come to on q4 um but moving forward we're probably running the company with the idea of between forty five and fifty percent on a net debt cap basis moving forward any other questions not from me thank you and congratulations again good luck thank you thanks jason thank you our next question is a followup from the line of alex baron with housing research center please proceed with your question yeah thanks for taking my follow up um so i noticed in arizona you guys managed to open several communities this quarter um just wondering if there's any more in the pipeline going into next year or is this we're gonna be the community count through through next year yeah alex this is leonard you're right um you know over the last five months we've opened seven communities and three to different locations and obviously we're very excited about the early results where we're seeing strong absorption and strong margins so again we're really excited about our team there on the ground we have one commute to be related to open in the first half of next year and um that's you know at this point we have other things that we're currently working on but that's primarily uh the one that we can talk about today yeah and it looks like well well we're at eight communities now at the end of q3 i think one of them probably drops off in q4 and then we're probably running that seven community range plus or minus for the year right depending on how quickly we sell through some of these communities yeah that's what we're expecting for the for the bulk of next year but it may take a little bit of q4 next year until we reload on a few communities we're working on now okay great um and then it's the i think you gave us a range for for next i mean for next quarter which is a little bit down versus this quarter is that mainly because of the impact of lumber or is there something else there it it really has to do with some of the closeout communities we have on the luxury condominium side where the good news is we're selling through those uh downside is that the margins are a little bit weaker in those communities and with on a higher average selling price alex so i think once those all get disposed of and delivered in q4 i think our margins look positive moving forward and again i think thirteen eight to fourteen two we feel pretty good about that but again part of it's gonna be what uh of those higher price lower margin communities sort of deliver and close out in q4s is primarily the impact for the margin okay awesome thanks best of luck for next year thanks thanks alex thanks alex thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i'll turn the floor back to mr web for any final comments thanks very much um as as all of you could see we have really made significant pro of rest over the last three months um and uh when and and and of course part of it is because of the improved housing market but uh a part of it has been in the works for a long time based on in our strategic planning and i wanted to command leonard and john because they've really done a terrific job um we really believe the future is bright for the new home company and we're extremely excited about the next two years as we move forward so with that i wanna thank all of you and uh stay tuned because uh again there's uh there's a light at the end of the tunnel thank you thank you is conclusive today's conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your
