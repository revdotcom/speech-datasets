prior year period with that i'd like to turn the call over to thanks matt and good morning everyone i'd like to start off today by recognizing our associates around the world for their dedication and invaluable contribute issues during this unprecedented time their response to the covid nineteen pandemic has been humbling and inspiring they're working tirelessly to ensure our facilities are up and running so that we can con need you to provide customers with the tools necessary to carry out their essential work our suppliers have also been incredibly supportive as this crisis has unfolded every one of our associates customers and business partners is making a difference today and i'm incredibly grateful for their collective efforts given how top of mind the impact of the virus is we thought we would structure the call a little differently this quarter before we run through our first quarter results i'll highlight a number of our innovative solutions that are part of the direct response helping to fight covid nineteen i'll provide a recap of the trends we saw across our end markets through the month of april and i'll wrap up with a few words on our announcement about the upcoming ceo transition at dana her we're incredibly fortunate to navigate these these turbulent times from a position of strength with a resilient portfolio of businesses and extremely talented team and the dana her business system is our driving force these recent events have certainly presented a number of unforeseen challenges across our business is but they've also created opportunities for us to support our customers and the global community in the unprecedented fight against covid nineteen we're proud to support frontline healthcare providers with much needed diagno to testing capabilities today and to support the pursuit of new treatments and vaccines for the future as we collectively strive to contain this no no novel virus diagnostic testing from i essential information to help us better understand and ultimately curb the spread of covid nineteen i d t was an early leader in this effort as their primary and probe kits provide a key detection component in covid nineteen diagnostic tests to date i d t has shipped kits to enable more than thirty million diagnostic tests for the virus in march sepi has launched the first rapid molecular test related to covid nineteen that provides highly accurate results within forty five minutes with a leading global install base of more than twenty three thousand molecular diagnostic instruments including five thousand in the us sepi's tests are being deployed on the front lines to test patients and protect healthcare workers since sepi's test became available the team has shipped a approximately two million test cartridges and going forward we now expect to be able to ship approximately six million tests per quarter greatly exceeding our initial expectations recently published in dependent studies indicate that cepi's test performance is best in class versus other point of care platforms on the market today providing superior virus detection with one of the fastest time to results the market leading caliber of cepi's test combined with their significant production ramp up is a testament to this innovative team's commitment to tackle this global health crisis head on at beckman colter dot agnostics the team announced that it is developing assays to identify antibodies to the virus we expect these antibody assays will play a critical role in understanding immunity and in turn improving the world's ability to man edge covid nineteen going forward beckman will be launching one of these assays shortly a high sensitivity automated igg serology test the team plans to ramp production capability to more than two million s in may and over thirty million tests per month by the end of june this assay will be able to run on beckman's global install base of more than sixteen thousand immuno assay analyzers as we look ahead toward potential new therapeutics and vaccines for covid nineteen paul and citeva are supporting biotech researchers and manufacturers around the world who are working tirelessly to find a cure paul filtration solutions are designed into the bioproduction process of multiple leading vaccine candidates and sita is supporting numerous vaccine programs in development providing specific prototype affinity resins and helping them prepare to scale up production volumes these are just a few examples of how we're helping to accelerate our customers important pursuit of covid nineteen testing treatment prevention and ultimately a key her speaking of <unk> i want to take this opportunity to officially welcome the team to dana her we're thrilled to have them on board with the addition of sita we've doubled our annual revenue in the highly attractive by l pharmaceutical and market to more than five billion dollars which represents approximately fifty percent of our life science platforms annual revenue with a more comprehensive offering across the entire bioproduction workflow we're better able to support our customers who are working to deliver more life-saving drugs faster and at a lower cost and important endeavor that's certainly accentuated by today's global health crisis <unk> off to a great start here in twenty twenty and achieved approximately ten percent revenue growth in its first quarter given the significance of the acquisition to our operating results we will include citva's performance as part of our old we're all core growth revenue metric beginning in the second quarter so now let's take a look at our first quarter results sales grew three percent to four point three billion driven by four and a half percent at core revenue growth the impact of foreign currency translation decreased revenues by one and a half percent geographically high single digit revenue growth in the developed markets was partially offset by high single digit declines in high growth markets revenue in china was down more than twenty five percent as a result of extensive shutdowns related to covid nineteen while january and february were solid across north america and western europe we saw a downturn and demand toward the end of the quarter when the pandemic became more severe across these regions growth profit margin for the first quarter was fifty six point two percent and i operating profit margin with sixteen point one percent adjusted diluted net earnings per common share were one dollar and five cents we generated six hundred and ninety four million dollars of free cash flow a twenty one percent increase year over year helping to support our strong financial position now we'll take a more detailed look at the results across the portfolio life science reported revenue increased one and a half percent with core revenue growth of two and a half percent led by high single digit or better core revenue growth at paul idt and beckman life sciences the global effort to develop of covid nineteen related testing and treatments drove demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions that strong performance was partially offset by declined in our more instrument oriented businesses like a my for systems and cyax which were negatively impacted by deferrals of large capital equipment purchases this dynamic was particularly acute in academic research as most of these labs around the world remained closed due to covid nineteen related shutdowns moving to diagnostics reported revenue was up six percent with eight percent core revenue growth led by very strong results at our point of care businesses set it and radiometer cepi had achieved more than forty percent core revenue growth with broad-based strength across all major product lines and geographies particular strength and cepi's fluid act a was driven by the common nation of a more severe blue season and increased testing during the coronavirus outbreak we also saw early strong demand perception's covid nineteen test which received us fda emergency use author at the end of march our radiometer business achieved high teens core revenue growth surges in hospitalized patients being traded treated for covid nineteen drove demand for radiometer's blood gap instrument and tests a key parameter to monitor in critically ill patients with the largest global installed base of blood gas instrument radiometers well positioned to support clinicians and patients through this unprecedented healthcare channel and beyond beckman culture diagnostics core revenue decreased mid single digits solid performance in north american western europe was offset by significant declines in china as a result of the extensive shutdowns initiated in january these containment measures resulted in very few patients going to hospitals for treatments or procedures that were not covid related to covid nineteen which greatly reduce core laboratory testing volumes moving to our environmental and applied solution segment reported revenue increased one percent with two and a half percent core revenue growth in our water quality platform may single digit core revenue growth with led by double digit core revenue growth at country our water businesses provide essential products and solutions used to test and treat water around the world a mission critical service in any economic environment good demand for our consumables and chemistry continued while equipment sales declined toward the end of the quarter as the broader macro uncertainty prompted many customers and municipalities to postpone large expenditures core revenue at our product identification platform was down low single digits with growth and marking and coding offset by declines in our packaging solutions businesses at video g equipment sales were down but we saw strong demand for consumers across consumer packaged goods medical and food and beverage and markets as widespread shelter in place orders drove a surge in consumer for so the first quarter was challenging on many fronts but we believe that the combination of our outstanding team's dbs driven execution and differentiated portfolio enabled dana heard outperform on a elective basis so moving on to what we saw in april the trends across our end markets through the month were largely a continuation of the dynamics that began to take hold during the last few weeks of march we continue to see a bification across our life science and markets covid nineteen related research and development increased significantly over the last sixty days among our pharmaceutical and biotech customers particularly in areas like anti-viral therapies vaccine development and immune response research and testing in turn this generated strong demand for our bioprocessing genomic and automation solutions good momentum also continued for other non covid nineteen related bioprocessing driving demand for filtration chromatography single use and selling gene therapy products however most academic research labs in the us and europe remained closed and labs in china have only recently started to reopen these closures have resulted in significant installation delays for existing instrument orders and in appears that customers are holding off on new capital purchases until the labs reopen and they fully return to work looking across clinical diagnostics we continue to see very strong demand through april from a regular point of care and acute care testing which is also driving increased instrument placements globally this contrasted with lower activity in hospital labs and reference labs where the significant declines that elective procedures emergency department visits and wellness checks continue to negatively impact testing volumes we also saw delayed orders and deferred new spending on larger capital equipment in these labs in the applied markets the divergence of demand between consumers and equipment persisted through april consumables remain solid as customers sustained essential business operations like testing and treating water and safely packaging consumer product goods in medicine but equipment purchases are being delayed as mission critical operating expenses are prioritized over larger capital investments the cadence of these end market dynamics of here's to be consistent with the spread of the virus with the negative impact in north america and western europe trailing that of china china gradually improved in april as lockdowns were lifted and businesses started to reopen and evident growth was slightly better than initial expectations heading into the quarter in north america in western europe we believe that the clients are beginning to stabilize and expect modest sequential improvements over the next few months and these regions begin to gradually reopen in light of these recent trends we expect second quarter core revenue growth including site to be in the range of flat to down ten percent so to wrap up as i reflect on the events of the last few months i am humble by our team's dedication and innovative response to this unprecedented crisis true to our core values our those suits are listening to our customers and innovating to help address their toughest challenges never before have these challenges been more collectively urgent and abundant and i'm so proud of how our associates have risen to the occasion looking ahead we feel very well positioned to navigate through this uncertain environment we believe that the combination of our outstanding portfolio exceptional team and dbs driven execution will continue to differ dana her in twenty twenty and beyond now before we go to q and a i wanna address the press release that went out last night regarding our upcoming ceo transition after more than thirty years at dana her he including the last six a ceo i've decided to begin the transition to retirement i do this knowing that dana her has never been stronger the combination of our portfolio enhanced exit usion around innovation and our season leadership team driven by the dan her business system create a strong foundation for continued outperformance i have loved every day of the past three decades and throughout my entire and her career i've been privileged to be part of an incredible team i've always considered the primary responsibilities of my current role to be focused on deploying capital efficiency enhancing the portfolio driving innovation and developing town and i can now look back fondly on the tremendous progress we've made on all these fronts i plan to see the corporation through the challenges of the next few months and i'm confident that our portfolio and the team are both in a fantastic position to thrive in the years to come many of you know ryder blair well from his days as president of six and more recently as our ep leading the evolution of our life science platform enhancing the platforms growth and margin profile while leading the acquisitions of paul i d t and cytova to name just a few there is no question that ryner is the right person to lead us into the future with the support of our senior leadership team and our board i'm confident that ryner is well prepared to execute our strategic priorities and continue creating significant value for our sharehold so what's next for me well first off that question is one for several months from now but i'm looking forward to spending more time with my family and i'll continue to serve on the boards of medstar health and the college of the holy cross i'll remain in the ceo role through september first of this year and i'll be around into twenty twenty one in an advisory role but for now and as soon as we finish this call we will be right back to work because we have a lot to do in the coming months with that i'll turn the call back over to map so we can start taking your questions thanks tom that concludes our formal comments crystal we're now ready for questions thank you once again to ask a question please press star one your first question comes from the line of derek de ruin with bank of america um hi good morning hey dare hey um so a couple of questions um and then uh i'll i'll congratulate you on on the retirement i'm jealous by the way um so to start off so so can you tell us what you're embedding into the guide in the two q for um covid related contributions i mean you're producing a lot of you know sepied tests you know the syrology is ramping um i guess are all those tests going to be used are they all spoken for i'm just curious in terms of repeating about utilization and sort of what's embedded into the the the guide thanks sure okay thanks thanks derek uh happy to um walk you through that a bit so if let's go right to the to the covid impact in q2 and i would think about it as um largely a tailwind that probably represents you know five hundred basis points of of of of of of improvement or growth that's associated predominantly with safety radiometer and idt and in terms of the related a question about what's spoken for um you know stephanie we're we're flat out at stephanie um we are we are continuing to expand our capacity um but every test that we produce every single day uh gets shipped and the demand is continuing to build um radiometer also running flat out um not quite the need for expanded capacity we had the surge capacity we needed there but they're doing exceptionally well um and id t holding its own as well so i think overall you'd consider <unk> and idt certainly um contributors on the positive side um what that really means is that the rest of the portfolio is you know potentially down anywhere from five to fifteen percent and those heavier headwinds are gonna come in businesses like like vetman diagnostics like bio systems a bit that are more patient volume dependent and will have to see whether that patient volume you know coming from loosening up of elective procedures starts to return but certainly the greater bit of headwind is in the equipment oriented business like lms and cyx and a bit of p i d no doubt so now putting all of have together you then partially offset that with with probably a bit of positive from paul and cytia that are showing positive growth that's not exclusively covid related but certainly related to the future developments around therapies and vaccine so i think that's the way i'd sort of generally frame up the uh the the pluses and the minuses around the covid impact in in q2 and that it's matt hey eric it's i just wanna make sure also um you kind of uh you mentioned sorology we are not assuming anything here in the quarter for sorology even though we're ramping up with beckman and we're gonna have some capacity here our view is that it's just a little too early to really kind of tell you know what the volumes might look like what a national testing program or any other kind of local testing programs might look like so that that covid tailwind does not include sorology just to be clear oh great that's really helpful and and i guess just one question on site eva um and and in general did you see any stocking in the first quarter and i'm just curious what are you assuming for organic revenue growth in the it standalone business for the second quarter um derek we saw uh you know very little it's always hard to tell when it's you know uh on the margins um as to whether or not there was there was stocking going on there um you know generally we don't don't think it was particularly material but i tell you it's up to a great start as i mentioned uh ten percent ten percent core growth in the first quarter really strong momentum in the core bioprocessing uh business and and and that's really driven by folks we're and on solutions to covid nineteen um and but you know as we look forward i think we we have really as you can imagine can we just close the the uh the end of march first of april um we're just getting in there to really understand what that funnel looks like and you know there's there's plenty of uncertainties about um how much that volume will build over time depending on the the progression of therapies and vaccines so i think we've got an outstanding start here but um you know in terms of where we are from a guide perspective on on site tv we're we're still trying to size up what that backlog is starting to look like um obviously we haven't even gotten face to face with the team yet from an operating reducing a point given the uh the limitations we here have here on travel so right now we're gonna focus on obviously good good deal of rebranding work that we need to do um we're gonna stand it up as a standalone operating company execute on the tsa and exit the tsa work streams and costs and make sure that we're embedding dbs into the into the business and and working on opportunities to continue to improve its performance so we'll we'll come we'll come back to you and give you a better sense of what it looks like in the balance the year once we get a little bit more stability here in terms of uh how the how the bookings trans look and uh uh we round the corner here coming into the second half of the year great thank you thanks dear your next question comes from the line of taco peterson with jp morgan morning taco thanks good morning tom i'll start with the congrats on the transition i think it might be helpful to hear for you why why now is the right time i know you you plan these things out well in advance but you know i think people were caught a little bit off guard in the middle of a pandemic after closing your largest deal so could you maybe just talk a little bit about you know how long this transition had been planned and why now is the right time sure absolutely taiko i'd be happy to um you know i i can honestly say that you you would have to go all the way back to um my very first year uh in the role where uh we along with the board made sure that we talked about talent development about ensuring that we are progressing in various ways through our leadership ranks to get to the point where we are today and and and had an outstanding choice in ryan or blair um to succeed me so this has very much been um the culmination of a succession planning process that really is going on over the last uh over the last five or six years um we we always want to to do something like this when we're in a in a position of strength and i think the combination of where we are with the portfolio and our performance where we are around driving innovation and growth and the strength of our team and talent really is what i i think uh makes us very comfortable that that this is certainly a a good time um to turn the rains over it was super important that we got citeba closed and um and and that we gave ourselves time to ensure that the transition here um of the role um allows both ryan and i to to uh contribute to ensuring that it comes into the organization um sm so um i think it's really a combination of all those things um you know i think that the the the dana her board was uh incredibly supportive and constructive around this all along i am uh i i am really excited about about ryner and um the the talent and the capabilities that he brings to this role and uh he's just gonna do a fantastic job so um we uh we all feel great about it okay thanks and then for the followup just a question on uh on some of the longer term uh covid related uh tailwinds you know for <unk> there would presumably be less rule in rule out you know flu testing uh tied to covid going forward so i'm curious how you think about that and then how you think about durability of that test once uh there is a vaccine on the market for beck being curious if you can put anything around pricing uh personality and then lastly for <unk> and paul just curious how meaningful you think vaccine and therapy development could be for those businesses you know on a multi thanks sure thanks tyco um you know there's uh we've got a lot going on as it uh as it relates to the future um impacts of covid and i think in many respects we're pretty uniquely positioned both on the short term and the long term um i think if you start with from a diagnostic testing perspective um cepi's impact along with idt radiometer in terms of treatment on the front line as well as beckman and certain in srology and ig igg testing i mean that that's a pretty unique combination of capabilities now you asked about the durability of the sfi test i think um you know as you know well we are one of the role leaders in flu testing and i think as we see the future here you're gonna you're gonna look clinicians are gonna be look looking for the opportunity in doing flu testing to also be doing covid nineteen testing and i think the ability to run those tests on the same platform in the same cartridge jobs with the same cartridge configuration um is a real advantage and a real opportunity we have uh perception of course as this surge in demand now is happening we're seeing that not only in terms of the test purchases themselves but it's driving a significant increase in our install base and so as that install base has grown you're also gonna see that install base driving not only covid nineteen testing but continuing to support um expanded blue testing and market share gains perception over time and obviously there's a broader suite of tests that run on the separate architecture and so that's gonna benefit as well so we think there's exceptional durability um to uh to the the separate architecture in an environment even in one where we have and and god willing we will have both therapies as well as uh as well as vaccines um in terms of your your question about beckman and soil g you know i think the way we see sorology evolving over time is you're it's gonna be primarily driven obviously with a blood draw and you're gonna see the sorology test the igg test integrate it into more routine testing and therefore um the cost per test is gonna be quite reasonable um and it's gonna be in line with other immuno assay tests and uh so while we talk about the the capacity to have thirty million is i think matt said earlier wouldn't build that into any models but i think it it's representative of the fact that um sorology testing that igg test is gonna become more of a standard um in basic testing when it comes to a you know a say so i think a lot of a lot of terrific potential there particularly as it relates to advances in uh in public health and population testing um and some of the work that's being done by public health authorities um to look for hotspots over time um in terms of your question about cyteva and um and and and work around uh therapies and by vaccines i'd say both paul and cyteva are uniquely positioned to provide you know pretty critical inputs meaning filtration and resins to both vaccine and therapeutic candidates um right now we would estimate that they're greater than a hundred and fifty therapeutic and vaccine candidates today um and paul and sitava are are working with a majority of those in some capacity and uh so obviously there'll be there'll be winners and losers but we think we have a number of exceptional positions there with uh with folks that are likely gonna be part of the future therapy um and or um vaccine uh answers so i think uh good good spot to be in great i appreciate it and uh congrats again on the retirement thanks teco your next question comes from the line of the jay <unk> with <unk> i s i morning bj um morning guys and uh tom uh congrats on uh on a weller and uh uh rest um i think uh you know maybe starting with a leadership uh question here tom um you know you may you know rainer um not not you know he's known to the street uh but uh perhaps uh you know not not everyone knows him well uh and you did mention that he was the right person maybe contrast your leadership style was uh with that rainer's leadership style uh what what does rainer uh bring here um you know and what should the investors look forward to under this transition sure well um i'd start uh bj with the fact that um ryan and i have worked to gather closely um for virtually all of his his ten years um you know i don't know if everybody knows that when when ryder was first uh first hired um at dana her um he came in initially as as the president of video jet and i'm not sure ryan and his wife elaina had actually unpacked their bags when uh we had uh we were looking to to succeed me at cyax after the cyax acquisition i was headed off to beckman and uh we had this outstanding uh a standing leader uh would just come into video jet and a real needed cyax and and uh ryder uh repacked and and moved to boston and and led cyax for for a number of years and just did an exceptional job and and he and i have worked together literally every day since then um through the the the work at cyax through the acquisitions of paul and and i b t obviously throughout the tremendous work that he did identifying the opportunity that has become <unk> our largest acquisition ever um and so you know when you work together um for as long as we have i guess there there do tend to be quite a number of similarities um about the two of us but you know vj you're gonna have plenty of time to ask ryan or that question he'll probably have a more thoughtful contrast between the two of us than than i will uh he's a he's an outstanding individual he is super smart he is steeped in in the domains not only in life science but but across dana her um he's unbelievably well respected across dana her as a dbs leader a great teacher a dbs practitioner and somebody who lives and breathe the dana her core values and and our shared purpose of helping realize life's potential every single day um you know his track record relative to m and a and his bias towards driving innovation by being willing to uh to place bets um both early stage bets as well as more mature bets to drive innovation um is uh is unparalleled so i um you know i i i hope and believe that you'll probably see a lot of similarities between the two of us in terms of what we value um but uh you know ryner we'll uh we'll put his own mark on dana her and i am supremely confident that that mark on dana but dana her's gonna be an outstanding one and an indelible one that's helpful upper back to tom uh just maybe uh one uh housekeeping uh you know question for perhaps for matt matt i think um you know the press release had a couple of hundred basis points uh contribution from <unk> um that perhaps employees uh you know double digits maybe even a low team growth in the business i just wanna make sure what the business is doing ten percent i think in the q1 uh you know continuing double digits in uh to q uh is that just uh the business um you know um growth as usual or uh was there any contribution and perhaps from uh you know covid related to that business and then perhaps uh also address that you know detrimental margins here for truth you thanks guys yeah sure so from a side eva perspective i mean i i i think you know a group ten percent there in q1 i think that's probably a reasonable place you know for the business to be here in the second quarter as well so i think your your math on that is pretty correct um as far as detrimental margins go i think um the place that i'd start is probably about forty percent detrimentals it can vary you know quite a bit depending on mix et cetera but i think starting with forty is a good place to start um i will tell you that uh you probably in q2 and diagnostics though probably need to be more like fifty or sixty percent detrimentals and that's all related to fx so that delta will be because of fx here in the quarter so forty overall maybe a touch higher here in q2 in in diagnostics thanks guys thanks ej we have reached the a lot of time four questions your last question comes from the line of scott davis with <unk> research hey uh good morning guys and congrats tom thanks scott good morning it's it's been a great six years i mean we um i'm a little surprised you're you're going but i don't blame you it's uh retirement sounds pretty interesting right now that's that's what it was it was it was not warned by the current economic uncertainties it was very much part of the plan yeah sure sure i believe that anyways i wish you the best i know we'll see you before you go but anyways thank you a great run thank you but um i just switching to business you know what what are the challenges of integrating it here in this kind of new world i mean can you can you really teach dbs and do kaizens and all that stuff and you know on a zoom video yeah thanks for the question scott um uh uh yes is the is is the answer to that why do i why would that be the case given how important being at you know you know we use that term being at gemba being in the real place you know how important we talk about that being well we actually kicked off uh dbs training what we call eco executive champion orientation we we kicked that off um virtually you using microsoft teams uh just two weeks ago um i kicked the i kicked it off writer was on the call john <unk> who you know from our dbs office led the led the effort we probably touched we got more people to with that eco um over that day day and a half i forget the full duration um because of actually being able to use a virtual tool and so a digital tool and so um the answer is we're we're we're working we're doing our best we're off to a good start um we're we've gotta get creative um we've gotta invent new ways to uh get things done um interestingly our our existing businesses outside of <unk> are in fact um doing multi-day high end um using virtual tools using zoom using microsoft teams and um it's it's not the same it's different um we wouldn't use that as a standard going forward we we absolutely value being face to face but um you know we we've challenged our teams to get creative and continue to drive continuous improvement even in this environment okay that's encouraging um just switching gear i know there's been a lot of questions around <unk> and that this should be but you know if you go down to environmental and applied solutions you've got some interesting businesses and different cyclicalities and such is there kind of a range of outcomes and two key that you know we can start to think about for those businesses i know you made some encouraging excuse me comments and video chat but and and actually just water too but on an overall basis at least tom is there some color you can give that yeah yeah you know scott um these are fantastic businesses um even in a challenging economic environment i mean you know hawks leadership position in water quality analytics you know four to five x it's it's nearest competitor um video jet you know a leader from a share perspective as well both um obviously heavily skewed towards uh their their balance of sales skewed towards consumables um you know north of seven seventy five percent in those businesses being uh after market consumables and service when when water quality testing has to be done every single day and municipalities around the world when consumer packaged goods have to be marked and shipped every single day around the world uh those consumables continue to underpin you know reasonably steady performance i mean they are a safety net under the uh under the revenue structures of those businesses and um while there be some other dimensions the like the equip inside in uh in water quality for example or even in p i d and some of the uh some of the software businesses that'll be a little bit more pressured here um you know i think those are still really solid businesses even in these challenging times so uh i wouldn't uh i wouldn't trade those businesses for uh for for for any in their markets i i should ask it differently i guess should it will this segment be down more than your corporate average um yes well yeah i mean i think they would be down uh down a bit more um only because they're they're not buoyed by the terrific performance that we continue to see at at cepi and and idt as well as radio and even with the you know what we think it's gonna be pretty solid performance at at <unk> paul so um yes i think these businesses would be at the at the lower end of the of the of the core growth um you know component you could potentially see the the segment eas down potentially mid to high teens um inside of the guide okay perfect thank you and congrats again tom just a light scott good to hear from you today crystal that that concludes our our questions did you want to give any final remarks well thanks everyone for joining us today we're around all day for questions this concludes today's conference call you may now disconnect
