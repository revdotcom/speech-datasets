times due to the coronavirus we implemented changes in our operating environment to ensure our employees remain safe and healthy our multifaceted response to the government imposed involved terry factory shutdowns resulted in minimal disruptions to our business i could not be more proud of our employees as they came together to support one another our customers and our vendors it goes without saying that ensuring the health and safety of our employees will always be our number one priority as discussed during our first quarter earnings call we were seeing significantly lower volumes in april may impeded by lockdowns across the globe due to the coronavirus in june as the regions began to reopen revenue started to trend up for the first time since march in many of our markets our experiences in line with industry trends and our customers continue to depend on us during the quarters to support their needs july revenue us have continued in line with june and our position and our markets is strong let's begin by talking about our fcc business fcc revenues which rebounded in june we're about flat with june two thousand nineteen after experiencing the thirty percent decline in the first two months of the quarter in north america our largest region scc had six percent growth in the month of june versus prior year june several large north american projects started during the quarter which will can to you into twenty twenty one european volumes rebounded in june exceeding june two thousand nineteen volumes by two percent as the region reopened after being locked down in april may fcc in latin america was into acted by reduction of demand due to lockdowns in most of the countries which continued through to june in the asia region china began to recover during the quarter although southeast asian australia remained in lockdown during june are verified business continues to grow although at a slower pace versus pre covid nineteen due to the downturn in the global construction industry now turning to sbm we saw a slowdown in project activity and distributor demand during april may with volumes down thirty seven percent during this two month period particularly in markets experience construction restrictions or shelter in place orders sales volumes improved in june with north america which is our largest region ending the month one point five percent behind june of two thousand and nineteen we continue to win and progress on large project activity including airports bridges and office building projects and we secured a number of infrastructure projects in north america which will support us in the second half off additionally some projects that began pre-pandemic continued to progress during the second quarter gcp's products applied in other outdoor applications such as our fire-proofing product line experience less of a negative impact the positive momentum during the month of june continued through july and we see a stronger third quarter compared with the second quarter while we are mindful of local spots that may impact our customers due to the covid nineteen virus our strategical for spm is for sustainable organic growth particularly in our north american building envelope and residential product lines and by increasing our presence in underserved segments and market geographies that are profitable and growing in the long term our plan also includes expanding our product portfolio awareness to adjacent market segments in accelerating the launch of new and accessory products for the premium in mid-tier segments this program is starting to gain action and this evident in our year over year june revenues in north america i'm also pleased to report the launch of two new products for weather barriers and surface coatings that we believe will gain traction in the coming quarters there was several other accomplishments from the second quarter that i would like to highlight gcp's gross margin improved a hundred and thirty basis points in the second quarter to thirty nine point one percent fcc's gross margin improved for the six consecutive quarter this is a result of our continued focus on our manufacturing and freight productivity initiatives that we started in two thousand and nineteen we also saw the benefit of raw material deflation throughout the quarter second quarter set lane general administrative cost decreased by approximately eight percent mainly due to lower employee and related costs during the quarter as a result of our restructuring programs and lower discretionary spending cost containment actions including reduce travel we're put in place during the quarter in response to the crisis gcp's cash cash position remains very strong with three hundred eighteen point two million of cash on the balance sheet at the end of june netcast provided by operating activities during the six months into june twenty june of twenty twenty total seventeen point six million is we continue to execute on our working capital improvement projects i am happy to report that we completed the sale of gcp's cambridge headquarters on july thirty first twenty twenty planning is underway to locate a fitting location for our headquarters the a hundred and twenty five million transaction and locks value for gcp shareholders in is consistent with the company's commitment to invigorator it's focused on profitable growth value creation and appropriate capital allocation strategies in addition today we announce approval by gcp gcp's board of directors of the high hundred million stock by that program with the authorization in place management will work with the board to determine the best way to execute on this program i'd now like to turn the call over to craig who will review the company's financial performance in more detail along with segment results and our comments on the third quarter correct thank you randy and good morning everybody just a reminder all revenue and associated growth rates in my comments are on a constant currency basis before we summarize our second quarter let me verse just say that we are very pleased with our results for the quarter and year to date considering the challenging operating environment during the second quarter our teams remain focused on their objectives and continue to provide a high level of service and commitment to our customers i'll be at more challenging with the current environment first i will focus on the revenues for the quarter gcp sales of two hundred million were twenty three point seven percent lower than prior year due to the impact of go and imposed restrictions on construction activities and manufacturing as a result of covid nineteen impacts due to covid nineteen varied by product line in geography during the quarter but generally remained within the twenty five to thirty five percent on favorable impact expected as we entered the second quarter although the demand in april in may was down significantly our june revenues did rebound for gcp overall and specifically in north america as the economy opened up although um at north america revenue is finished two percent up for june versus prior year and we see continued strength in north america in july europe asia and latin america also finished june much stronger than the first two months of the quarter however the rebound was not as generous and it was in north america due to a slower overall return to normal construction activities uk volume has been italy improving but at a little slower rate than continental europe china volumes have come back since the country reopened and the rest of asia including australia continue to improve but are still impacted by covid nineteen government restriction latin america volumes steadily improved during the quarter however some countries remain under lockdown where lockdowns are not present we are seeing good construction activity and volumes globally with respect to price gcp was close to flat year over year at a zero point one percent price decline fcc captured price most notably in latin america where in country inflation due to currency devaluations occurred and we increased price appropriately fbm's north america and asia regions experienced some price pressure and which was expected in the current deflationary period when oil prices are at historical lows the two exactly quickly though to continue to secure appropriate volumes and margins during the quarter on current and future project bids gcp's gross margin increased a hundred thirty basis points to thirty nine point one per then primarily due to lower raw material labor and freight costs driven by operational productivity which were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reduced operating leverage during the period to lower sales and production volumes selling general and administration costs of sixty five point seven million improved by five point seven million or approximately eight percent during the quarter benefiting from lower employee and related costs due to restore management of other discretionary costs including advertising and favorable impact of the covid nineteen restrictions on travel entertainment and other operational activities some second quarter restructuring activities didn't to the second half of the year due to the limited access to offices and travel restrictions which it made it difficult to execute in some countries due to covid nineteen we will continue to execute on our restructuring plans and are currently assessing our sgna position relative to overall sales volumes in the environment managing these costs is a high priority as we monitor our performance metrics and expected volumes over the next three to six months gcps lost from continuing operation attributed to gcp shareholders was one point three million compared to income from pendingly operations attributed to gcp shareholders of three point one million for second quarter two thousand and nineteen the change was primarily due to lower gross profit due to lower sales volumes partially offset by reduced restructuring and repositioning costs lower selling and general administration costs and slightly lower tax expense gcp's adjusted ebit margin end of the quarter at six point eight percent versus nine point six percent in the prior year quarter primarily due to lower gross profit as a result of volume declines partially offset by lower selling general and administration costs adjusted beta margin was twelve point eight percent for the second quarter or a hundred basis points lower than the same period two thousand and nineteen looking at the specific performance of our two segments you can refer to pages ten and eleven scc sales were down twenty point five percent to a hundred nineteen point five million north america's revenues decline ten point seven percent in the quarter as construction in most states was deemed essential and our customer at work in north america continued to service their customers although at a slower pace versus prior year during the quarter however reorder rates in june were well ahead of prior year other regional sales declined in other regions twenty seven to thirty percent versus prior year during the quarter with the sales declines all mostly a triple vote to covid nineteen impacts in asia europe and latin america due to covid nineteen have been slow more prolonged and deeper versus north america revenue in june versus the same period for two thousand and nineteen in north america and europe both increased five point seven percent and one point six percent respective compared with june two thousand and nineteen price gains also occurred in latin america and and europe on a nominal basis uh with slightly offset volume declines during the quarter fcc's gross margin in approved by three hundred fifty basis points during the second quarter six consecutive quarter of gross margin improvement as randy mentioned raw material deflation operation and logistics productivity and favorable regional mix all contributed to margin expand s e c segment income was nine point nine million with an operating margin of eight point five percent which decreased ninety basis points compared with the prior year quarter primarily due to lower sales volume uh on favor impact by operating leverage partially offset by higher gross margin fbm sales uh totaled eighty point five million during the second quarter a twenty eight percent decline versus the second quarter two thousand and nineteen due to challenging construction markets as a result of covid nineteen sales volumes in april may were below two thousand and nineteen volumes due to reduce construction and manufacturing distributors in april and may did not at a normal pace due to the uncertainty of the impacts of covid nineteen on future product demand north america volumes did however rebound in june as a construction resumed in many north america locations with the distributors reordering and larger projects restarting once customer covid nineteen safety procedures were instituted in line with government and state recommendations in june north america sbm c hills were down one point five percent versus prior year june however positive year over year reorder patterns were evident in july business in france germany italy in the uk for sbm also improved during june once overall restrictions were lifted sbm's gross margin declined a hundred forty basis points to thirty nine point seven percent compared to the second quarter of two thousand nineteen due to the unfavorable impact of lower sales resulting in reduced operating leverage and increased inventory right off year over year partially offset by raw material deflation and productivity sbm segment operating income was eleven million with operating margins at thirteen point eight percent a six hundred ten based point decline versus prior year this was due mainly to lower sales volume on favorably impacting operating leverage and lower gross profit partially offset by the benefits of reduced discretionary costs and employee related costs during the quarter now to earning back specifically to gcp gcp's effective tax rate was a hundred thirty six point four percent for the quarter that included the reversal of the first quarter cares act tax benefit resulting from changes in our forecasted income for the year the company no longer expects to have a net operating loss carry back for two thousand and twenty of which it did expect in q1 forecast gc's net cash provided by operating activities was seventeen point six million for the six months ended june thirtieth two thousand twenty versus a usage of cash of thirteen point one million for the six months ended june thirty first two thousand and nineteen adjusted free cash flow totaled eight million for the first six months compared with a usage in total of twelve point three million during the same period in two thousand and nineteen accounts receivable management improved twenty point eight million vendor payables deliver to four point one million improvement and inventory is generated a one point seven million improvement compared to the prior six months we continue to improve the transparency of our working capital initiatives throughout the regions and within our respective country operations and we are seeing the results of these efforts which will continue please refer to slides twelve and thirteen for our discussion on gcp's first half performance gcp's net sales for the first six months total four hundred nineteen point four million decreasing fourteen percent compared with the prior year mainly due to the second quarter impact of covid nineteen on volumes gross margin for the six months increased a hundred thirty basis points to thirty eight point four percent the net loss attributed to gcp shareholders in the first six months total point two million compared with net income attributed to shareholders of twenty four million for the first half of june two thousand in the nineteen the change resulted mainly from the reduced sales volume to covid nineteen in the second quarter partially offset by reduced operating expenses adjusted ebit was twenty seven point eight million for the first six months or twenty five point one percent on favorable for the same period in two thousand and nineteen again mainly due to the impact of covid nineteen turning to our outlook for two thousand and twenty although it continues to be difficult to predict the duration and next dent of the impact of the pandemic on our business over the next six months and beyond as events unfold the near term view is as follows as discussed june's positive volume trends have continued into july and we have expect the third quarter to be a significant improvement over the second quarter planned and funded construction projects have resumed or are coming online with construction sites having implemented additional health and safety protocols along with social distancing the these efforts are important for construction to remain active while hotspots may arise while we expect the demand to improve and slowly return to close to normal levels as the year progresses some projects have moved into two thousand twenty one which may dampen some demand in the latter half of the year and we are monitoring this closely as for the third quarter of which we have the best view we expect the impact of covid nineteen pandemic to reduce overall demand for our per products by approximately five percent versus prior year in constant currency we also expect raw material deflation to provide a modest offset to the forecasted volume declines however we will continue to deliver productivity to support our margin we remain focused on our operating expenses which we have continued to improve sequentially during the year and in addition to our restructuring programs which will continue we have identified additional cost savings opportunities and have learned a lot during the covid nineteen period on how to perform at a lower cost base while we service our customers very well we are implementing these learnings as we move through the year we remain on track to the plan capital expenditure reduction of twenty twenty five million in two thousand twenty or a reduction of thirty five to forty five percent from our original plan capital spending and we expect our cash position will grow throughout the year based on the working capital programs we have initiated the reduced capex target versus original plan and of course the sale of our cambridge site the share we purchase program announced will be funded with our existing cash balance looking beyond the pandemic we are confident in longterm fundamentals of gcp and the construct industry we are confident that our current plans will allow us to navigate the pandemic and will be well positioned at the overall construction demand stabilizes somewhat during the second half of the year while we focus on our overall cost position as a company i'll turn it now back over to randy thank you thanks greg uh just a few closing remarks let me just say again that we have welcome to the board members and their enthusiasm and interest in working with the gcp leadership team has been constructive but we team relationships have been very engaging and we look forward to jointly continuing to create value for our gcp shareholders despite the challenges the covid nineteen virus presented in the second quarter our teams around the globe continued to focus on our customers and we are happy to see june rebound as a day we will continue this focus going forward and our strong balance sheet which features significant liquidity in no near term debt maturities is competitive differentiator that provides substantial financial flexibility in position as well to successfully manage through the ongoing economic challenges and uncertainty caused by the covid nineteen pandemic with the sale of the cambridge facility in the stock buyback program we are committed to maintaining a flexible liquidity base and along with the board we will continue to evaluate all alternatives for the effective and efficient use of cash i would like to wrap up my comments by thanking our employees personally and on behalf of my leadership team for all the hard work and efforts they continue to devote to gcp under extra challenging conditions i really appreciate that thank you today for joining our call and we now look forward to taking your questions you will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press start and once on your touch on phone if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the key to withdraw from the question two please press star then two the first question is from mike harrison of seaport global securities please go hi good morning morning mike morning mike and congratulations to craig on the uh the permanent role uh and cfo um thank you mike wanted to ask uh if you can talk it sounds like you're pretty confident in the direction of things and the trends that you're seeing in north america i was wondering if you can maybe give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in other regions um you know maybe specific areas where you feel like they're you feel like they're making better progress toward normal construction activity for some areas where you have more concern or more uncertainty on the pace of that progress toward normal no it's a good question mike and um you know just like we see here in north american we hear about every day on the news you know some states are reopening faster than others and are getting back to some some type of normalcy well the same can be said around certain countries in europe as well as certain kind trees in the asia pacific region some have just been much slower due to restrictions and and also due to some hot spots of resurface and getting back to normal activity so uh we're gonna follow that through the next quarter to see what happens um we do believe that um the construction activity in that those two regions europe and in the apac region will indeed start coming back in the third quarter um we just don't know the pace by which that's gonna happen again do mostly to these restrictions all right and then in terms of the restructuring um you mentioned some additional cost areas uh that that you um have have learned to operate on a lower cost base um i guess i'm just trying to apply your your guidance of a five percent impact of covid on the top line trying to think about how that looks on the bottom line as you maybe hang on to some of these additional cost actions that you've delivered and continue to see improvement in uh in in the raw material environment no it's it's another good question like we've obviously gone through an experiment here over the past you know four months or so on a global basis to see how can we run our company differently given the fact that we have to work differently in this pandemic and there's a lot of lessons that that have come out of that in terms of you know working home strategies how we service our customers differently how we do virtual um go lives and virtual uh test trials you know we our customers so a lot of those learnings we're gonna take going forward as most companies are and we do believe that's gonna lead to lower cost of how we run our operations we've also learned a lot at our plants in terms of inventory management again driven by this crisis in terms of different techniques some different processes that we've built in to be able to to better manage our inventory and better manage how we service the customers globally so a lot of lessons that we've learned and the goal would be going forward that these lessons are gonna find their way to the bottom line anything you wanna add for uh yeah uh mike it's a good question uh we've done a lot of uh just priority is our our employee safety of course during this whole process and you know we've we're doing a lot of virtual training with our customers we're doing um mix design training with our customers virtually we're starting to learn that uh sometimes and our customer's behavior is starting to come around a little bit that that's acceptable um we also um implemented a gc plus uh program uh of ordering online that uh randy and and uh the customer service group and the it group implemented about uh six months ago we're seeing traction on that now just orders coming through online versus a sales rep or someone having to take these orders which obviously it's costly when it has to be handed off to eight different people to take orders um you know more back in the nineteen sixties industrial kind of process so we're seeing a lot of progress on kind of the new wave of how you do business uh and we're we're getting advantage of that in the in the cost base and we're not gonna go back and invest the money back in there now that we see the advantage so we expect uh savings to continue in q3 and four relative to those and we're having good discussions uh with the whole team uh about how we continue that into two thousand and twenty one even if things uh come back to normal and and covid nineteen kind of relaxes a little bit so that that that's really uh uh uh quite a bit of money there if we can keep the momentum going um i can't say exactly how much it'll be in two thousand twenty one but we'll probably have a better idea as we go through a q three and an an additional point to make mike that uh you know would like to add we're in the individual position that we're gonna be looking for new headquarters going forward as we've mentioned and um having this learning of this new environment that we've been working in should play into our decision so it's it's definitely um you know the world has changed and we need to take that into consideration looking forward all right and then in in terms of you mentioned some larger projects that looked like they were getting pushed into twenty twenty one um are you pretty confident at this point that these are delays and not cancellations maybe just uh talk about kind of what you're seeing in terms of the backlog on on some of those larger projects yeah so um another good question i mean i wish i could answer you you know a hundred percent that their delays not canceled but for right now they're delayed um there's certainly some projects that would've got started already in q2 um they're not started um there is some probably concern on funding and social distancing as you know these big projects when they start them uh the timeline is very important to them so i just think for now as long as the economy stays about where it's at and um there's not incremental hotspots that people need to be concerned about i think they're pushed out i don't think if they're canceled there's funding for the projects uh there's still a lot of money around um that's not the issue um people just are a little bit more apprehensive um to to start a project especially a big one right now with a social distancing you know specific costs even on the supply chain side we've actually given our customers a little more confidence in our supply chain our inventory is slightly higher than when they want to be we want them to be but we've actually had some backup inventory just in case one of our plants goes down and i think once other companies start to do this um folks will have more comfort to spend the money on these big projects so they can get full supply chain support from their customers all right and then the last question for me is is just maybe on the decision into authorize the a hundred million dollars of shared purchase can can you talk about uh your capital allocation priorities uh going forward and maybe any guidance on on the timing of this or purchase activity thanks yeah no mike we um obviously have always had a pretty comprehensive view of capital allocation and returning our money to shareholders now with the new board in place and we're excited again to have their input and their guidance and specifically the strategy operating at risk committee uh we'll be working with management and going through the various options we have uh what makes the best sense for the shareholders and it's gonna create the most value for shareholders obviously this was the first decision that was made regarding capital allocation the a hundred million dollar authorization for the buyback um but the overall uh board once in the strategy operating committee once they get up and and functioning fully uh this will be a discussion point um going forward mike yeah i'm all set thanks very much yes mike okay i'll just add mike maybe out to one of your other questions i mean these big projects are in the infrastructure category they're not in commercial or retail projects that type of thing so you know we're we're more confident they're pushed out than than canceled just just the category they're in is is more comforting for us the next question is from <unk> of g research please go ahead thank you good morning everyone good morning good morning rosemary uh you talked about the board uh the board's input on your strategy going forward uh so between the new board and what you have learned during the covid well we are still in it but uh during covid could you touch on what changes you are thinking about in your for your strategy going forward is there anything very different from what you were planning in doing ahead of those two events no what i would say rosemary we've been working very closely with the new board we've had several meetings over the last couple months and we're still in the phase of of sharing our current strategies and getting their input on areas that we could focus on differently and areas that the ideas that they have that we can investigate so it's still in that phase of getting to know each other and putting forth the best strategy for gcp going forward i'm really excited with what i've heard um again mentioning this uh the strategy operating risk committee um a lot of experience and a lot of ideas and uh we're gonna continue to work with them closely in the coming months and to come on that but um but we're excited to have this different perspective on on how the company could be doing things differently and in terms of what you learned you're in covid so you have learned that you can operate at a lower cost there is a certain amount of discretionary cost um can you quantify how much of those you think you will generate in twenty twenty and while you may not have a hard number for twenty twenty one how much it comes back with volume yeah so rosemary in in q2 maybe this will give you some guidance and uh i know some others might want it um in q2 uh of about the six or uh i guess about six million dollars of operating savings we had you know mostly sg and a um it's about a third a third a third it's about third restructuring about third actual implemented costs uh savings and about a third due to kind lower activity due to covid nineteen so um our our challenge to ourselves is uh you know can we keep that third um you know savings due to the covid nineteen lower activity so that's a couple million dollars a quarter so we're challenging ourselves to determine how we continue to get our volumes at prior year volumes and still uh still execute on that so that that'll that's about all the guidance i can give right now um but we're still working through that and to determine whether we can keep that through the year or not and in terms of restructuring rosemary um we we're focused on continuing the initiatives that we set forth you know supply chain initiatives and obviously looking at um asset management better um but with the input with the new board work so that uh there'll be some new ideas to come into that so restructuring is not gonna stop restructuring will continue and that'll be uh be an input into um our savings going forward all right thanks and i was wondering if you could give us a feel as to how i'll verify um operated during the this center and i assume that if a simmon track does not go out then there is no use of verify but you are also doing some virtual trials can you give us a feel for the momentum in that particular area uh yeah um we we were actually pleasantly surprised on the revenues with verify during the quarter uh they were up fifty percent uh year over year um in q2 uh that's mainly due to the fact we had more more equipment out there in q2 this year than we did last year cuz the installs uh in the latter half of two thousand and nineteen um the interesting part about that business is that they they tend to use the trucks on any job that have verify so um our trucks go out first with the verify units on them because they need to keep their operations kind of solidified cuz that's the new operating model they're on so we didn't really see a lot of decline um of usage of the verify units uh during the quarter uh and certainly not as much as uh maybe we saw the market and in north america the market was pretty strong and that's where we've got most of our units um so that's why we had the fifty percent pop in revenue we have seen slightly slow down on installs of new customers only because it's difficult for them in social distancing and you know managing the behavior of their organization and um you know at this time during covid nineteen they do have to change the behavior of the organization to get the value so we've seen a little bit of slow down but we did see um you know um in australia new zealand um in asia uh some new contract signed uh during q2 and even into q3 here um so we're pretty pleased at the progress but certainly it'll be slightly slower on the installs in the second half here um but randy do you have any other comments no i just wanted to say that as well i mean it's in four with our customers that we hope to have installs that they're just distracted with the virus and it's difficult to install units when you need their help and you have the social distancing restriction so that's kind of slowed down to craig's point sure that makes sense i was wondering if you could give us the level of importance for your business between residential construction commercial construction and infrastructure spending so we can and if you can talk of the about the twins in each of those categories what are you seeing yeah so um uh north america is where we got the best visibility on the market data but obviously globally there's uh ihs and others that come up with the data um we're tend to be if you want to think about it about a third a third a third i mean about a third of our revenues tied the infrastructure a third to commercial and uh about a third to residential and people could be so surprised on the residential piece but uh the north america concrete and cement uh you know basically goes into residential uh also and that's a big part of our business um we're pretty confident that infrastructure uh governments uh you know you know may up to spend and on infrastructure going forward uh just to to pump the economy so we're pretty pretty confident that that's gonna happen globally and they're gonna there might be some delays here just on getting things going but we think we're we're good at good there on the residential uh the market seems strong i think you've seen the statistics too both in north america and around the world uh china asia uh residential still keeps going strong so i think we're in good shape there um commercial could be slightly slower uh just you know you've seen the retail new is uh you know there's obviously um some reconsideration on office space on what you really need for office space moving forward so i would say commercial is probably the place where we might see a little bit more slower uh uptake but i think the infrastructure and the residential will offset that and in fact we get very good margin on the infrastructure so we'll probably get a margin mix that will offset any decline on the commercial side if there is one moving forward all right thank you very much again if you have a question please press star then one there are no i additional questions at this time this concludes our question and answer session thank you now turn it back to becky power for closing remarks thank you katie uh we appreciate your help today and uh thank you all for attending the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today's presentation you may now disconnect
