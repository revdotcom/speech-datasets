for our second quarter update i like to begin by acknowledging that we're all adjusting to a new normal as we focus on saying safe and healthy during the coronavirus we're living in a world of video calls facetime webcasts working from home where face mask and washing our hand a lot and we're connecting in new ways like you many of us aren't in our offices and aren't able to see one another face to face in fact today is the second time nearly too much that steve rashy steve lindsay and i have been in the same location rest assured that we're distancing and disinfecting and getting the job done it's not easy to stay connected in times like this it's five are connecting with us you feel like a handshake at the front door but without the ability to actually shake someone's hand we found ourselves leaning into other expressions of caring and friendships like how we listen how we check on our elderly neighbors how we smile and way below the strangers it's how our crews stop work take off their hats and put their hands over the heart when a funeral procession drives by these moments of connection and and fire the good in all of us and provide the energy it takes to walk through a time like this a time when some communities are impacted more than others but none you'll untouch a time when we understand how essential our service is and how people count on us to deliver a time when safety has an expanded meaning and personal protective equipment becomes an everyday necessity but it's fire it's easier for us to pivot we have a very clear mission that guides us answer every challenge advance every community and enrich every life through the strength of our energy you see we believe we are called to answer this and every challenge that arises we know that people rely on our energy every day and that we are an essential service we know that we cannot let our customers and communities down and we know that safety is a core value a value at the heart of every decision it's because of the deeply held belief that we set in motion a broad range of protected steps to address the coronavirus health crisis and its economic impact on our customers while passionately protecting the health and safety of our employees and communities we began an early march by activating our incident support team or the ist across functional team of twenty five leaders from operations and all our shared services the i s t has been needing nearly every morning to discuss challenges solve issues and coordinate actions from hr policies to supply chain access to ppe and impact to employee customers and operations by the middle of march we activated the highest level of our crisis response plan by convening our crisis management team or cmt i have steve lindsay to lead the team a fire a chief operating officer steve immediately gathered all of our chief officers and business unit presidents to quickly make executive decisions around broad ranging challenges steve will talk more about this in a moment from my perspective i'd like to say that it's been inspiring to watch the ist and cmt work together we bring a collection of expertise to our conversations from the very professional perspective of fires leadership to our external involved out with the american gas association and our first-hand conversations with medical experts the other many hospital boards we serve on together we get are careful to balance the needs of our many stakeholders including you we are coming locating early and often with all employees and customers we are connecting regularly with our board and keeping our governors legislators and regulators informed every step of the way this importantly the cmt is keenly aware of impact our decisions have on people and everything we do our goal is to flatten the curve and help control the spread of coronavirus while safely and reliably providing energy for our customers and communities thank goodness our largest operations are in missouri and alabama areas of the country that have been minimally impacted by the pandemic in fact only eleven of our thirty five hundred employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and all but one person is back to work so as we work to meet the challenges created by the coronavirus we remain focus on our strategy to deliver growth and value by growing organically investing an infrastructure to advancing through innovation we continue to take steps to ensure that we remain strong both financially and from an operations perspective we'll hear more on that from steve and steve when they discuss our capital spending including investments the new business and infrastructure upgrades as well as our updated capex forecast that supports our long-term growth outlook as reported in our earnings announcement this morning our second quarter net economic earnings for share with below last year and our s y twenty plan a steve rashy will discuss in more detail the results were driven by lower margins due to warmer weather across our footprint margins that were not fully mitigated by regulatory next andism however our results were minimally impacted by the coronavirus and finally we'll spend some time updating you on our process as we continue to pursue favorable regulatory outcomes across our jurisdiction for the focus on the issue this case and filings in missouri with that i'll turn the call over to see lindsey to discuss our results and coronavirus responses in more detail thank you suzanne i wanna begin by acknowledging the outstanding efforts of our employees during the difficult times brought on by the coronavirus and the resulting economic shutdown you're providing great service for our customers while taking extra care to ensure their health safety and wellbeing as well as your own and helping support our communities in this time of need and we all thank you very much suzanne mentioned we quickly activated the cmt with ten primary areas of focus morning i'd like to take a moment to outline the steps we've taken to address the coronavirus limit its impact on three of those areas our employees customers and communities keeping these stakeholders healthy safe and supported is more than a priority for us it's a core value it's who we are aspire for our employees we have educated everyone on healthy practices and encourage people to follow the advice to the experts including the cdc and other public health organizations our guidelines include staying home with not feeling well frequent hand washing social distancing and other best practices we implemented policies to help employees handle the impacts of the coronavirus including taking care of family members or dealing with children being home from school example of this is the implementation of our emergency lead program for our field workers and technicians we have taken extra safety precautions to protect them and our customers we pre-screen the customers premise to ensure that no one is sick or symptomatic before we allow our workers to enter a home or business and we equip our employees with personal protective equipment for our office-based employees we implemented a work from home policy starting in march and extending through may along with work from home in social distancing we've also implemented related policies to eliminate all non-essential travel as well as group meetings and gatherings and across our company we stepped up the frequency of cleaning and sanitizing our work locations currently we're developing work transition plans that include reopening offices and facilities for our customers we are first and foremost focused on making sure they're well served and that they continue to pro and that we continue to provide safe and reliable energy that they come to rely on regardless regardless of the situation at hand help reduce customer contact and limit the potential for spreading the illness postpone work that wasn't time critical or urgent and to help our customers through what is surely a difficult time financially we've work with our regulators to suspend involuntary disconnections and late these through the end of may also expanding customer bill assistance programs at the company we have pledged five hundred thousand dollars matching gift to augment the contributions made by customers employees into our dollar health program thousands of customers have already signed up to give and their match gifts total more than three hundred thousand dollars so far similarly we have donated two hundred fifty thousand dollars to local area food pantries and meal program from alabama to wyoming we're helping provide about six hundred fifty thousand meals for families struggling to make ends meet during this time we also let an effort with other companies to donate and set up laptops for children and limited income schools so they're able to learn from home since we're all in this together we've been coordinating and staying close communications with various state and local government bodies healthcare organizations and industry groups to ensure that we are doing most good by leveraging our collective energy and resources all we've been hard at work to address the impacts of the coronavirus and serve our customers well we've also remained focused on our business objectives centered on growing our company we continue to invest in organic growth and infrastructure upgrades across our utilities for the first of fiscal twenty twenty we invested fifty three million in new business keeping up keeping pace with last year's record levels of investment and new premise activations as you can see our investment in our utilities is expanding year to date we invested two hundred seventy nine million dollars focused on new business and pipeline replacement that's up twenty four million or nearly ten percent for the first half of last year on the gas related business side our spend is actually down year over year large we reflected the completion of the sdl pipeline for the full year of fiscal twenty twenty we've increased our plan capital spend to six hundred forty million dollars up thirty million from our prior forecasted investment about eighty eight percent out of our two thousand twenty spend will be on our gas utilities with two thirds of the increase or about twenty million dollars attributable to utility investment we also plan to invest ten million dollars in the third order at fire storage regulatory mechanisms we have including incentives to accelerate system upgrades in missouri in alabama and real time great making in alabama are key to timely recovery and support infrastructure modernization earnings growth and better environmental four months to reduce methane emissions as you know from our discussion last quarter in missouri we have been working through a number of interest cases decided by the missouri public service commission going back to twenty sixteen that have been challenged and appealed by the office of public council resulted in adverse of pelic court rulings late last year at the time of the appeal court orders we said we would pursue all avenues legislative judicial and regulatory to preserve the ability to continue investing in the safety reliability environmental performance of our pipeline system while achieving timely recovery the start of the missouri legislative session in january we worked introduced bills in both the house and senate to clarify the israel statute as it relates to the eligibility of infrastructure upgrade spend for accelerated recovery the senate bill passed early march on may sixth the house passed the substitution of the senate bill given the differences between the versions passed in each chamber the legislation will now go to conference committee to i can file the two versions meanwhile we have continued to file new essence requests including one early february late last month we the staff of the missouri public service commission and the office of public council reached to unanimous stipulation in agreement subject to missouri psc approval that would result in an eleven million dollar annualized increase in risk revenue regarding the cases subject to the appeals court ruling these have been remanded back to missouri public service commission for final resolution following the denial of our request for the missouri supreme court review in mid march the commission has a hundred twenty days or until the middle of july to render a decision including whether any refund is required anyone who would like more detail on the various is cases there's a table in the appendix of our slide presentation today finally in alabama we have been implementing new off system sales and capacity release program that went into effect december first we're also continuing to pursue the benefits of the accelerated and for structure modernization writer or aim and are on track to achieve the threshold number of miles replaced this year in order to qualify for the roe adder in twenty twenty one like we received this past year with that i'll turn the call over to steve rashy for a financial review and up to good morning and let me add my wishes for good health and safety to everyone and a huge shout out to all of our first responders healthcare workers and our own team who continue to serve verbally every day let me cover our widely results the financial impact of coronavirus and an update to our targets for the second half of our fiscal twenty twenty turning to our results for the quarter we delivered consolidated net economic earnings of one hundred and forty four million that three point nine million dollars from last year our gas utility posted earnings is just over one hundred forty four million down two point four million from last year as a result of warmer weather and losses on investments as marketing delivered earnings at just over five million dollars down just over one million from last year as higher volumes from our expansion we're offset by less favorable market conditions and higher costs and we saw higher earnings from the fire sdl pipeline which enter service last quarter a lower loss from fire storage reflecting the benefits of our operational improvements and slightly higher corporate cost looking at our per share results current your earnings have two dollars and seventy five cents per share we're down fifteen cents from last year reflecting lower earnings as well as the impact of preferred and common stock issued over the last twelve months but offer two additional comments first suzanne mentioned we saw limited financial impact from the coronavirus this quarter since it really didn't hit our service territories until mid-march or on the forward impact in a few minutes and secondly as reflected here economic attorneys continues to include all interest revenues or saying in another way excluding the provision we book for gap purposes for this quarter this was revenue subject to a provision where two point two million dollars including interest bringing the cumula to provision at march thirty one to sixteen point nine million overall weather this quarter was warmer than normal by eleven percent in missouri and by twenty six percent in alabama compared to last year's cold weather we saw margins in missouri declined by three million dollars as slightly lower residential volumetric margins were upset by higher net district revenues combined with a significant drop in commercial margins our southern utility showed margin growth is lower demand was offset by annual rate increases margins were also significantly below our expectations of normal weather and mitigation mechanisms that offset that exposure again in our southern service care the mechanisms largely worked as planned in missouri however we saw a seven million negative impact to margins against a normal weather consisting of two components first w n a r this new weather normalization tools introduced in our last rate proceeding and should ensure that we get the right recovery of the residential volumetric charge not over collecting in cold periods not under collecting in warmer ones while the mechanism did address a portion of a weather deficiencies this quarter we estimate that it was ineffective by six percent or roughly five million dollars secondly we saw a short fall in commercial and industrial margins that do not have weather mitigation in missouri in even for smaller more sensitive customers total impact here was about two million dollars we clearly have some work to do both working with our regulators to improve the effectiveness of our weather mitigation and our next missouri rape receiving and two generating earnings from other sources in the back half of twenty twenty to offset some of this headwind there were two other key variances this quarter o and m expenses and other expenses is that line here in slide thirteen total o and m expenses as reported we're down twelve point six million dollars and although we have a history of cost control this reduction reflects the benefit of a regulatory deferral of a pension we measurement charge with the offsetting expense for ordered in other expenses as shown here excluding this adjustment our run rate utility o m was up two point nine million or two point six percent due to higher operations and employee cost the remaining o m expenses represent higher marketing costs due to our business growth and the cost of the fire sdl pipeline which is now in operations the other key variances in other expenses with a run rate increase after the adjustment for the pes pension re-measurment of c point five million reflecting two items first prior year by sdl pipeline a f u d c which no longer existence is now in our operating numbers and secondly at three point six million dollars wing in returns on investments help to support our non-qualified benefit plans not surprisingly this year we saw unrealized losses this quarter compared to a much stronger earning stream in the first quarter of two thousand nineteen i note that the explanation of all cost variances contribution margins as well as our review of our year to date results are included the appendix to this presentation for your reference you know since the help crisis began we've been focused on our liquidity position parking back to our playbook from the great recession we moved aggressively with the assistance of our bank group to draw on our credit facility in mid-march as the commercial paper market became an economic in late march we secured a hundred fifty million term loan to provide additional liquidity and we stand in a strong financial position with total available liquidity at march thirty one of six hundred and sixty one million and a solid long term capitalization as well in fact we issued equity early in the quarter with proceeds of just under ten million dollars as we turn to the coronavirus impacts on our operating results a bit of perspective roughly seventy percent of our earnings and margins are residential and the current help crisis hit near the end of the winter heating season where we earn a majority of our return as a result we've been relatively insulated so far from the economic downturn we are watching closely our personal and industrial customers especially the smaller firms who are bearing the brunt of the of the current shutdown and we are tracking the incremental cost of the actions that steven suzanne touched on a few minutes ago now none of us have a crystal ball to predict college that you issue will play out based on what we know today including data and regional economic projections we've constructed a forecast of key impacts based upon the following assumptions from an economic standpoint continuation of the downturn through this quarter and then a slow ramp up an activity that will stretch at least through the rest of calendar twenty twenty from an operational standpoint normal weather a return of normal collection activities disconnect in late payment fees as well as minimal disruption for our construction crews based on these assumptions we have estimated the following financial impacts as a result of our moratorium on fees we have anticipate losing the revenue of roughly one point nine million dollars we have seen some decline in our commercial and industrial margins reflecting both the temporary shutdowns of large manufacturers and anticipated lower demand from our smart commercial accounts we estimate that impact to be approximately two point two million dollars we have not yet seen any appreciable change in our residential margins and we will continue to monitor that closely however we are anticipating a significant increase in bad debts in the coming quarters to estimate our exposure we went back to our records for the last recession in two thousand eight in two thousand nine when we saw bad debt expense as a percentage of avenue increase about twenty basis points over normal levels flying that experience to our current book of business results in an estimated exposure of three and a half million dollars and of course we're tracking other at cost including the cost of p p e enhanced facility cleaning employee costs for lost time among others we are pursuing opportunities to offset these headwinds including identifying those costs that would naturally be lower as a result of at home order such as travel and we're finding additional operating efficiencies we're also working with our regulators as steve mentioned both as we have been uh to deal with the immediate impacts to our customers our business during the water and now discussing potential regulatory treatment of the increased cost including bad debts and the cost of responding to the health crisis and helping our customers recover stepping back our estimates are based upon a current view of the economic recovery and as you can see we have provided sensitivities on each of these key exposures to gauge the impact under a different set of assumptions looking forward we remain on solid ground and are focused on growth as steve mentioned we've upgraded our capital investment target for the year to six hundred forty million in addition we've updated our five year capital investment target now through twenty twenty four to two point eight billion that level of investment is driven by utility infrastructure upgrades and should drive rate based growth of between seven and eight percent for the forecast period in addition we reaffirm our long term net economics for shared growth target of four percent to seven percent and given the current uncertainty surrounding the resolution of our missouri district recovery we'll continue to refrain from ups guidance for fiscal year twenty twenty at this time and finally our financing plans remain on track with only modest equity needs for the remainder of twenty twenty so in summary we're in solid shape and remain focused on delivering for all of our stakeholders but that let me turn back over to you suzanne thank you steve and steve as we close today's presentation i think it's important to take a moment to acknowledge the strength of our collective energy fires utilities have been operating for more than a hundred in sixty years thanks to great leadership great partnership and a legacy of hardworking caring employees we have survived wars the great depression weather disasters and the nineteen eighteen influenza pandemic the law of successful history and with the support of our investors our communities and our public policy leaders we will work our way through the impact of the coronavirus we'll do it together and we'll do it in a way that brings sustain long term value for our shareholders customers and the communities we serve before we open for questions i'd like to thank fires employees many whom are listening to this webcast i know how hard you work and i know how much you are about one another our customers and the communities that we live and work in you make me proud every day and i am forever grateful for the way you rally to answer challenges you are leaders you are conveners you are how first you are heroes you understand that fundamentally energy exists to help people and you give your all to deliver energy safely reliably and with all your heart do the investors an analyst summit call today we like to thank you for your investment and the trust you place in us on behalf of our board of directors our executive team and our employees we take that trust very seriously especially during these uncertain times we look forward to seeing you again soon either as part of the upcoming virtual aga financial forum or other virtual conferences and road shows in the month ahead of course we look forward to the time when we can once again meet face to face and then we wish you well and trust that you will stay safe and healthy now we'll take your question we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your telephone keypad if you are using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster the first question comes from richie <unk> with b of a securities please go ahead and good morning uh hope everyone's healthy and safe today appreciate you taking my questions um just had a couple here on israel um can you just go over the the difference between the two versions of the house in santa bill and and where you ultimately expect that that to land uh once it gets reconciled and then on the um recent settlement um with the israel's filing where i guess what changed this time around with opc where you were able to go that's a settlement there hey richie this is steve lindsey um and i appreciate you calling in this morning uh on your first question relative to the legislation in terms of the content of our portion there's really not that much different between the house and senate bills what you have or some some things that that get attached uh as they go through the process and so really uh we're fairly consistent with those bills and again if you go back to what they're trying to accomplish uh it's it's to really reinforce what the intent of the it was when it was put in place over fifteen years ago which is uh around infrastructure upgrades particularly around bear steel and cast iron uh and and to really just kind of codify some of that in terms of the language so i don't think there's a lot of difference between those two and that's why when it goes back to the many for reconciliation uh there'll be some clean up relative to the things that that are attached there uh relative to your your second part of the question in terms of the stipulation i think we've just been working collectively uh and and again we we felt this way all along that that the the pipe we've been replacing uh meets all the requirements relative to what needs to be part of the infrastructure upgrades included in the insource program uh even to the fact that we still agree that that the plastics that we've been replacing are a much more efficient way to upgrade our system uh but this primarily for focus on the bear stealing cast iron and did they meet those criteria we're providing additional evidence but i think uh in terms of the reason that we've got to this is because we continue to work together to to strongly support again the intent of of why we've been replacing this pipe around say through reliability and efficiency of operating our system so i think it's i think it's progress if you wanna look at it that way and again even with the cases that are still there uh we'll continue to present evidence uh and hopefully make our case around the pipe that had been replaced in previous years uh is is the same price here that we're using going forward got it thank you that's that's very helpful um and then just around your your capex profile um i think you might have been been one of the few companies a rage you're spending this year for twenty twenty um just curious what what's given you the increased confidence to execute on the plan this year um given the the headwinds with covid related pressures hey richie this is steve great question um a couple things first of all i guess the downside uh the warmer weather that has impacted our margins is it does give us a little bit better uh working conditions on our capital spend and as steve talked about we had a strong uh winter season and now we're heading into the the heart of our our capital sped so i think that point number one and then number two you know a playbook for utilities as we look at how we can best um try to offset both the the headlines from weather and also the headwinds from coronavirus that we talked about um ramping up our capital spend is one of those activities it's clearly something that helps get us back to work and we're doing with the cooperation and understanding of the leaders throughout our states and our jurisdictions and i think is just helping us to ensure that not only are we doing the right thing by upgrading our infrastructure but we're also doing it in a way that's gonna make us even more resilient as we go forward so i think that it's really just an evolution of all those things and again you've seen us ramp up and ramp down in the past and we think this is an opportunity for us to ramp up a little bit and richard this is the other steve let me follow up from an operational perspective i would like to reinforce that as we and again while this past quarter was only really several weeks in terms of the measurement period uh we never stopped working uh and and you'll hear some businesses talk about return to work uh we talk about it more of the transition and if you think about it from a construction and capital perspective uh we we really didn't take our foot off the gas we obviously changed some of our processes and procedures relative to personal protective equipment and and to be quite honest we've limited going into customer's homes to do uh service uh tires and changeovers we'll go back and do that but but again in terms of the infrastructure that we've been working on and we'll continue to that really didn't slow down and that that's a great tribute to our our frontline boys the management that's out there that that really you know pulled together if you think about our three strategic areas of focus one of those is innovation and we got innovative in the way we're continuing to think about our work the other part i would just want to reinforce is that uh our capital for these type programs is fairly evenly distributed across our three major operating areas in terms of the east side of missouri west and alabama uh and so we're not just impacted in one area in terms of watching it up back we're fairly evenly spread even with the new business as well so if you think about that increase that we saw a year to date of nearly ten percent that our reference that's pretty evenly spread across all of our operating companies which i think gives us a good balance as well yeah i did thank you very much i appreciate the car that's all i had thanks the next question comes from michael winestein with credit sweesa please go ahead thank you okay i was wondering if you guys have a better sense at all uh how weather legislation would preclude uh the need for a ruling at the supreme court or not you know at this point you know after confirming with your own lawyers and maybe outside counsel um michael was steve um um the supreme court opportunity at least for the um the ruling that came out of the appellate court um has already passed they they um opted not to take the um i get it the appeal that we and the public service commission put forward so really the the legislation um that steve lindsey talked about is the best opportunity for a longer term fixed we obviously are continuing to work with uh the missouri public service commission the staff the opc and the other interveners to um not only crisp it up the um the support for filings uh but then also to get to a more uh unified view going forward to what makes sense for a cost and i i would say too that's not consistent with when we started this journey we pursued a regulatory legislative and judicial outcome and so all three of those paths so we're on track with what we strategically set out to begin with what's the uh july sixteenth decision that we're waiting on is that okay so uh so this would be this is on the cases that we're remanded back to the commission so once they go back to the public service commission uh they in essence have a hundred and twenty days to make a decision based on those cases that that did not go through to the supreme court so so you've got several moving parts that are going on here and from a legislative perspective and regulatory but but that is on the cases that that were under appeal that have been remanded back to commission well those decision the decision you're referencing there is the decision by the regulators right on the remed right yeah that's that's been remanded back to the missouri commission yes i got it i got it okay and on the guidance the long term guidance the base here is still two thousand nineteen that's right or you know base here yeah you know i i i chuckle michael what's your question i think the answer is if you look at our capital spend program over five years and driving rate base growth at seven eight percent we expect that we should be able to drive the kind of growth that we've talked about in the long term over the bottom line i chuckle because we're all dealing with and we've spent a lot of time and i know our peers are because you've been on those calls a lot of time dealing with the current situation and in the fullest of time is we understand what's happening in in the current year twenty twenty we'll find a way to rebase and make sure everybody understands but right now we're just trying to make sure that we and our customers get through this year and we do it in a fashion that we feel good about so that when we hit twenty twenty one and beyond we're hitting it at full steam with our customers coming along for the ride yeah that would be my understanding i mean i think a lot of people are trying to look through twenty twenty as a abnormal year so that's uh i just wanted to see what that's definitely gonna be an abnormal year yeah yeah i think a lot of people would like to look through this year um all right thank you very much guys and stay safe and healthy thanks thanks mark thanks again if you were have any questions please press star then one the next question comes from brian russo with <unk> please go ahead okay good morning morning brian hey just curious on the um whether normalization mechanism in missouri uh that was um you know quote unquote ineffective what you know structurally what made it in effective and what would you need to do in in so far as uh you know further discussions with uh regulators and or uh you know during your next ray case uh to fix it or can it ever be perfect all right well good morning this is steve lindsay thanks for the question and uh i wish i knew all the answers to that because it's a very complex formula uh i think the one thing i would say is is we have something in place now that we didn't before which is positive uh it did help but it didn't completely address the the differences between uh weather obviously and and and the volumes and the revenue so so i think there's a couple pieces to it one is and i think uh steve even mentioned it uh first all it does not even include the small commercial class and some of those others that are really weather sensitive and look and behave a lot like the residential class so i think that's one opportunity that if you look at other weather normalization mechanisms in the country they do include that so that's clearly an opportunity the other is that it's it's not linear and what i mean by that is every day isn't the same every week isn't the same as you go through the month so you could have some outcomes that show results of degree days that didn't really translate to the way gas load from a customer's perspective so i i think there's opportunity as we move forward and and again it's a it's a start uh it's not perfect we recognize that and we think we'll be able uh to make a pretty strong presentation as to where the deficiencies are because again the program is intended to mitigate risk uh as as steve indicated uh it's too cold we shouldn't benefit if it's too warm we shouldn't be harmed and it's really to try to tighten that band and what we would look to do going forward is to tighten the band even closer than what it is now got it and remind me what the percent of the over a bill is a fixed charge you know and that that roughly depends on you know the the type of year that you're having but it could be twenty five percent uh twenty to twenty five percent i think uh based on a residential customer and again that has variability obviously based on the type of winter that you have because that's where most of the volumetric piece comes in okay great and um just on um the supreme court denial of your record for re-hearing remind remind me how how many millions of dollars of revenues is that and when might that impact uh net economic earnings is it after a commission decision so uh the middle part of july or you know from a a legal perspective you know now have i don't know more clarity as to um you know the the the recovery or or of those calls uh you know i'm curious when a provision might be taken against an economic earnings um yeah brian this is steve ashley there's a there's a detailed chart in the appendix to our presentation that you can take away that which really outlines the various layers of of interest uh the total provision that is the total of all the collections that are included in the rulings that were um that are part of the appellate or decision and then the supreme court's decision not to take it on or sixteen point nine million dollars and that we continue to collect on those and we're collecting two million and change every quarter um so up until of the time that the missouri public service commission makes a final determination we will continue to collect those um collect those funds i would point out there are various components of that of that sixteen point nine million part of it has to do with um the the um conclusion whether um cast iron bear steel was worn out and curated and another component about um instead of plastics that are replaced uh along with longer lines of the cast iron bear steel and the public service can be is gonna have to weigh in based upon the remand from the appellate court on each one of those and when they reach their decision and that's that july fifteenth date that we've been talking about and the commission will not only decide on the on how to handle each of those individual risk determinations but it will also have uh determine whether or not um determine whether or not the um amounts will be refunded to the extent they determine there's a refund or if the amounts will be used in some other fashion and the commission has full right to be able to decide how they want to handle that so again that's at that point once we have determination from the public service commission then i think we are we're obviously obligated to take a look at our net economic earnings calculation and to the extent that those revenues are now not going to be earned revenues or earnings and then we would adjust our economics measure at that point and just to keep it in perspective of the sixty nine low or four million dollars of that um impacts our current year best majority of it was the initial provision that we booked uh app for the last this week okay got it understood and then uh just on the the equity uh if i heard you correctly you issued ten million of equity in the fiscal second quarter and that satisfy your needs for the entire year uh no i mean if you go to our guidance page you can see that we have um we have a guided range of um of equity of fifty to a hundred million dollars um as our total need for the year so in the first quarter we knocked out roughly uh ten million of that at the low end um and and the beauty of where we stand is we we do have that we're in ongoing discussions with our rating agencies we we do have some um leveraging some um cushion in our our credit metrics which are the ones that everybody's always looking at so um we do believe that um we will be in the equity markets later this year as long as the markets continue to uh rebound in an orderly fashion but it's not an anything we have to do but i think our preference is in order to maintain strong credit metrics and a balanced capital structure that it would be appropriate for us to get in the range of the equity that we've guided in our long term guidance okay and then the the february of stipulation for uh on eleven point one million revenues uh under issues is that what you filed for boy we filed for um and the reason why i'm struggling um brian is that we filed for a lot of different numbers because we filed for um amounts that had not been awarded for plastics and prior filings um i i think the best number to think about um in terms of what was our net expectation in terms of what we were gonna get out of the filing it was probably and uh i don't have it off the top of my head it was in the high eleven sort of low twelve million range and there's always some difference between we what we expect and what we actually get because our interest filings generally include forty five to sixty days worth of forecasted capital spend and so that always gets true up in a rate case and and that is clearly what happened in this and this violent force was i'm sorry okay and when does the missouri legislature end this year well you know we're we're kind of writing the playbook as we go right now uh there's probably at least another couple of weeks of session uh i know that again this is this is not a special session this was just to start up again and we were uh we were very pleased to be included as part of the legislation as being considered but uh we we can't came out or as we talked about we're out of both chambers and now we're in reconciliation so so we knew that ours is moving forward at a pace that uh at least we're we're pleased so far okay got it thank you very much thanks the next question comes from <unk> with uh <unk> please go ahead thank you good morning um lots been asked and answered so just a few follow ups and clarification if i could um just following up on that last question so we'll get a legislative response one way or another by the end of the month if that's successful then can you does that have any impact on on sort of the july outcome in your opinion well i i would say that it doesn't directly because it is a looking for but i think what it does is is give some uh hopefully guidance to the commission that that what we've been again operating under the assumptions of for over fifteen years has been validated uh and has been cleaned up if you will in this legislation again we think that everything we've been doing from this point forward from when the program went into place uh has has met those required i think this reinforces that so hopefully from the commission's perspective they can use that as part of their decision making in that the the infrastructure that we've been upgrading does meet these requirements and i'm i'm sure everyone on the phone is aware but it's not it's not usually for a house to produce a bill and then the senate is sent over to the other chamber this in this case the senate they pretty much write it the same way but not exactly the same way so then the committees are created and the steve said it goes to conference so that they can settle those those differences so that's not unusual at all in the legislative process right um let me just ask this your bill's not attached or it doesn't include other things that would be controversial so if it could get to the governor's death i think he's in i wouldn't call it i wouldn't call it controversial but like a lot of bills you know they're they're written in one chamber for a specific need and then it goes to the other chamber and the other chamber as a other elements which is what happened in this instance so that's when the two committees come together in conference and sort of clean the bill up to um and that's where we are and again that's not uncommon okay um i did you reference the additional investment in store or in store for ten million how much more is to go there yeah tom and this is steve we're still in the process of figuring out what our long-term development plan is obviously given some of the things we've been focused on you know we're clearly um very pleased with the operational performance of the storage field this winter and you saw that in the improved operating results and we but we having that come up with the longer range point and both what our commitment to uh to our investors and to you all is that we'll continue to bring you along for the journey and so as we think about the amount that we are gonna spend between now and the next call um that's the ten million that we um increase okay and then um just kind of going back to the effectiveness of the weather mitigation and i know um the guys looking at ways to improve that does that will that have to wait really until you go through your next rate case in order to be improved or could it be improved before then that would be uh yes so so your um your your question basically how to answer this so it it is uh part of the over rate uh rate structure and so that would be part of our next rate filing yes which i i would say again that's that's not unusual the two requirements of a rate case are set revenue requirement and rate design and it's very rare for commissions to take a up either rate design or revenue requirement outside of the rate case it does occur um but it's you know it's very rare and i would just add on i've got a little bit of a floor here it's it's not unusual either for these mitigation mechanisms to be in place as a starting point because they are complex and there are different classes of customers and even window in those classes people use energy in different ways either all heating or summer more year round and those sorts of things so they're they are a bit complex so i like steven steve mentioned i was glad to see the commission work with us and start and we'll continue to refine as we saw cases over time all right i appreciate it thanks very much excellent thank you again if you have a question please press star then one the next question comes from richard sunderland with jp morgan please go ahead i morning just um just one for me today uh thanks for taking the time the um the stl pipeline uh additional capacity um if i miss it earlier apologies but any um of on discussions around contracting that and i would imagine there have been some impacts from covid so maybe uh expectations at this point if any um yeah thank you for the question uh you know we'll continue to look for opportunities but right now uh first of all i want to confirm that it did go into service and served uh the side of the state very well as we went through the winter uh we'll continue to operate that pipeline the way it was designed to do and and access gas from the what used to bring to this side for our customers here uh again as as opportunities emerge but i think a lot of those opportunities have probably been been put on uh stand still right now as we're going through some of these challenges but uh as those opportunities are out there we'll continue to pursue the with the additional capacity so just just to follow up real quick the the opportunities as you see them would those potentially be um as soon as say twenty twenty one or is this more of a long dated opportunity to um put additional contracts in place and then i guess eventually add compression yeah so yeah good question uh we've shared with you in the past we absolutely can add compression to the pipeline um and again i wanna echo you know steve's comment from an operational perspective the the pipeline has performed very well this past winter even i mean it's against the backdrop of a warmer winter but we were able to exercise that pipe pretty well and from pressure and flows and and forth that operated again very well um there is additional capacity and we can't add compression and um there is a market and i suspect some of that will depend on how the um natural gas and industry plays out over time there's been a lot going on in our industry as far as wells and lock-ins and supply sources and those kinds of things so we'll we'll sort that over time but the pipeline operationally and there is a market sitting behind it so we'll we'll see how that thanks for the update having you thank you again if you have a question please press star then one okay at this time there are no further questions so this concludes our question and answer sessions i would like to turn the conference back over to scott dudley for any closing remarks well thank you all for joining us i know it's a busy earning day uh we're gonna be around throughout the rest of the day and we'll look forward to catching up with many of you then thanks and be fixed the conference is now concluded thank you for attending today's present day you may now disconnect
