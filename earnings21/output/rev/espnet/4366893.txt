join us for our second quarter conference call in the midst of the current pandemic we continue to take appropriate caution and maintain focus on keeping our personnel safe what can continuing to efficiently manage our operations achieving our strong second quarter results in the face of this unprecedented oil price collapse and difficult operating environment is evidence of the resiliency of our business plan and this solid commitment of our people throughout these times we have worked to quickly adjust to the rapidly changing conditions and align our costs with our business activity as well as preserve our strengths as we have discussed last core or any updates along the way stating we would be free cash flow positive from the second quarter on for two thousand and twenty we had significant free cash flow of thirty five million in this quarter this was driven by several factors including limited capital expenditures in the quarter as we completed our drilling and completion program for the year strong hedge position that delivered over twenty nine million dollars of realizations and significantly lower operating costs partially as a result of our may shut in and containment program but also sustainable reductions including the impact of our shut-in program our average daily sales volume in the second quarter was thirteen thousand five hundred and fifty five barrels of oil equivalent for boe per day even with reduced volumes and a forty four percent drop in average realized price for boe in the second quarter our cost management efforts combined with the strong hedge position allowed us to generate higher quarter over quarter adjusted net income and adjusted ebitx i suspect we are one of a very small group of our peers who can say that we expect to generate substantial free cash flow throughout the balance of the year which should result in a decreasing debt balance and help us achieve our target of being below one times debt to ebitx for the year as we previously previously discussed in response to the sharp decline in oil prices in april and very low forecasted may oil prices we need we made the decision in late april to shut in the large majority of our operated production for the month of may which resulted in approximately sixty percent of our total net production being shut in during may with a forecast that significantly improved june oil prices which ultimately were more than double our april and may oil price realizations we returned to full production in june we had a very successful quarter in focusing on cost reductions which saw us reduced total lease operating expense or l e in the second quarter by forty percent from the prior quarter despite reduced production volumes due to our chevy and program in may our teams continued focus on cost reduced resulted in a thirty percent decrease in l e p o e in the second quarter to four dollars and fifty three cents versus six dollars and fifty one cents in the first quarter this was the major driver of the overall thirty three percent reduction in all in cash costs during the quarter on a per unit basis our all in cash costs went from near thirteen dollars per boe in the first quarter to near ten dollars per boe in the second quarter for a total twenty two twenty two percent reduction this is all in cash cost folks which includes operating costs corporate dna costs and all of our interest costs on our debt to dive a little deeper into how we achieve the forty percent decrease in l o e let me outline some of the key factors first as much of our peers have done we were successful in negotiating price reductions with vendors across the broad range of our lease operating expenses from chemicals to maintenance rigs saltwater disposal contracts and compression costs second we are benefiting from our long-term practice of spending a little more money as we go repairing wells facilities and associated equipment to reduce frequency of maintenance which is resulting in a continued decrease in non-routine l e repair needs third workover repairs have trended down resulting from our optimization of lift method chemical program improvements and general approach of fixing things right the first time the limited offset frack activity also reduced frack hit related workover expenses fourth we have been successful in getting the ut companies to perform electrical upgrades sooner than scheduled which has allowed us to eliminate generator usage on some of our newer locations lastly with limited drilling and completion activity we have also been able to refocus our field employees towards lease maintenance which has allowed us to reduce contractor labor all of these items and many other subtleties of operating we're in progress if our team has a history of continually driving down costs we will remain focused on continuing to reduce costs across the board as we expect the oil price environment that we have observed since late two thousand fourteen including increased volatility to persist which only stresses the need to structure our business to be the profitable across a much lower oil price range i'd really like to command our operations team which did a fantastic job of both shutting in production in may and bringing production back fully online in june while also achieving these costs options for the first time in my career and our team's history we had to tell our guys to produce as little as possible every single day we executed this shut in operations and our field personnel did a great job of efficiently returning well to production and with little to no incremental expense and no adverse effects on our producers our wells have returned to their previous volumes with some wells producing at increased rates for a period of time plus the three wells in southeast reagan county that are brought online in april prior to the curtailments and we're shut in during may are now back online and have fully cleaned up and are perform performing well versus the type curve i mentioned we concluded our twenty twenty drilling program in late may and released our uh contracted rig operating in the mid midland basin so our plan capital expenditures are minimal for the balance of the year given that our program ended with eleven wells drilled but not can leaded and with our ample liquidity we have optionality on completion timing depending on market conditions with production return to full capacity we have entered the second half of this year with expectations uh for no further drilling or can police and activity this year we can maintain approximately flat year over year production in twenty twenty compared to twenty nineteen as a reminder we recently updated our twenty twenty full year production guidance ranging from thirteen thousand to fourteen thousand b o e per day which compares to twenty nineteen full year average of thirteen thousand four hundred twenty nine b o e per day further with our eleven drill but i'm completed wells in upton county we intend to carefully monitor commodity price think appropriate service availability and service cost conditions to determine if it makes sense to bring in a completion crew later this year or wait until early next year depending on the timing we anticipate the completion of those eleven wells would enable us to maintain similar year over year production for twenty twenty one with only a modest capital program for the completions which we currently estimate at around thirty million dollars with that overview i'll now turn the call over tomorrow to review the financials of edit mark thank you robert as we have in the past two consecutive quarters i'd like to first discuss our cash position in our balance sheet as robert mentioned we are pleased to achieve our goal of generating substantial free cash flow in the quarter with a total of thirty five point one million of free cash flow as we referenced in our first quarter call our plan was first to reduce our working capital deficit which we calculate excluding derivatives and we're able to do this by a little over fifty million dollars during the second quarter and then to begin to pay down our revolver debt the barn base center our senior security revolving facility which was set in late march remains unchanged at two hundred seventy five million dollars and to remain there and so our regularly scheduled fall redetermination process our outstanding bargains on the credit facility at quarter end hold a hundred and sixty eight point six million and we had one point eight million in cash with a hundred and six point four million of unused barring capacity that gave us approximately a hundred eight million of a core at eight quarter end i would note that as of july thirty first we had paid down our revolver by fourteen point three million compared to quarter end reducing our debt balance now to about a hundred fifty three hundred fifty four point three million and we do expect to apply free cash flow the remain of the year primarily to pay it on the revolver during the second quarter our capital expenditures several three point two million and year to date we have spent forty five million of our annual twenty twenty capital budget of fifty to sixty million dollars as robert mentioned we concluded our twenty twenty drilling program in may so we anticipate minimal expenditures during our man of the year and it will likely end up toward the low end of our guided strange now looking at our second quarter income statement starting with top line revenues for the second quarter of twenty twenty for twenty one point seven million compared to forty five point one million in the first quarter the declining was driven by a fifty four percent decrease in oral revenues to eighteen point nine million which made up about eighty seven percent of total revenues and ngl revenues fell by forty four percent while natural gas revenues rose slightly our average price in the second quarter for all three commodities was seventeen dollars and fifty six cents per barrel of oil equivalent which was down by nearly half of our average price during the first quarter by commodity our average realized price for crude oil in the second quarter was twenty three dollars and fifty six cents for barrel natural gas average eighty three cents for mcs and ngls average eight dollars and ten cents for a barrel one from a production standpoint our second quarter sales volumes average thirteen thousand five hundred and fifty five barrels of oil equivalent per day which was comprised of sixty five percent oil eighteen percent natural gas and seventeen percent at natural gas liquids at highlight this does include having cartel about sixty percent of total production in may on the expense side as robert also highlighted we did drive down our all impact costs from twelve ninety two per buey in the first quarter to ten dollars and eleven cents per boe in the second quarter we achieved this through nearly two dollars per boe reduction our lease operating expense to four dollars and fifty cents per boe for the quarter on the general administrative side we reduced our absolute was cash dna dna expense by about seven percent versus the first quarter which resulted in per unit cash dna expense of three dollars and thirty four cents per b o e as you know we reduced our cash dna guidance in may to fifteen point five to sixty point five million for the full year and expect to be somewhere in that range which at the bottom end is a twenty five percent reduction versus our initial full year plan in addition to some of the savings we articulate last quarter we continue to focus on and have had success in reducing expenses really any and everywhere including reduced users of third par a third party consultants reducing vendor rates and managing our costs tightly from an income standpoint we record we reported that net loss in the second quarter of thirty five point nine million dollars or fifty five cents per share which included a pretax unrealized loss of fifty million dollars on our derivative contracts our adjusted income was twelve point eight million dollars or twenty cents per diluted share adjustable ability share for the second quarter we are four adjusted ebitx of thirty nine point eight million in the second quarter which is robert mentioned is actually an increased quarter of a quarter now let's take a minute take a minute to update you on our commodity head results in the second quarter as highlighted we realized twenty nine point four million gain on our commodity the hedges for the quarter this is largely reflective of our hedge position entering the quarter and our locking in some really nice games on hedges when we made the decision to <unk> production and uh did that when second quarter nine x prices were about at the lowest point the hedge realizations also include a gain of about five point seven million dollars from an underline of one thousand barrels of oil a day for the second half of twenty twenty we remain really well ahead to the balance of the year with an average of sixty five hundred barrels per day of oil swap that in imx price of fifty eight dollars and thirty five cents stepping down to four thousand barrels a day for four year twenty twenty one at an imx price of fifty five dollars and sixteen cents per barrel with basic hedges and plays on similar volumes on the natural gas side we have seven thousand m m b t u per day of swaps at a henry house price of two dollars and eighty five cents for the second half of this year stepping up to eight thousand m b t u per day at a price of two dollars and seventy one cents for full year twenty twenty one with basic hedges in place on the same volumes hedge your remains a critical component of our financial strategy and we expect to continue layering on hedges as we get more visibility around the assumption of our drilling and completion activity going forward stepping back and looking at expectations for full year of twenty twenty we reinstated our production guide in july and we've reinstated ellie and production and as lauren tax guides with our earnings released yesterday our reinstated production of velar and tax guidance six dollars to six point two five percent to seven point two five percent is identical to what it was at the onset of our twenty twenty guidance provided in january as is the case for our reinstated le guidance of five fifty to six dollars for boe although we have had recent system animal le reductions and came in well below this range in the second quarter without the advantage of bringing on new wells we have kept our guidance range where it was at the end of the year when we anticipated bringing sixteen new wells online with that i'll turn it back over to roberts thank you mark we are really pleased with the results and confident in a bright future for our stone while we are sorry to see our industry in such distress it is creating more m and a opportunities than we have seen in quite some time we are actively evaluating a number of situations and expect to have more to consider throughout the rest of the year as prices remain low and distress situations continue to increase we believe that our strong balance sheet and track record as a successful consolidator positions as well to increase the scale of our company and add value to our shareholders with that operator we'll now open the floor for questions thank you at this time we'll be conducting a question and answer session if you'd like to ask a question please press start an under telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in a question queue you may press star two if you'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your hands up before pressing star keys our first question comes from the line of brad heffern with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question hi morning everyone hope you're doing well um i guess on the the twenty twenty one color that you gave about being able to keep production flat with eleven bucks um is that more just meant to be instructive or is that actually how you're thinking about the twenty twenty one plan um as we sit here today uh yes a little bit about brad um you know it does depend on where commodity prices head towards the end of the year whether we want to pick up a rig or not um i think we've been pretty vocal or consistent about our message that you know we need we need mid forty five to fifty dollars oil to wanna go back to spending large capital dollars um but outside of that uh at some point into this year early next year completing those wells will um allow it to main production flat year over year okay got it um and then obviously you made the comment on m and a uh can you go into a little more detail about sort of what opportunities you're seeing and also any thoughts you have about and ability to fund them um the opportunities are increasing um and size is variable from small to quite large as you seen you know distressed and bankrupt companies i think all of this will result in further um opportunities in terms of larger companies selling assets um it it is difficult with no public equity and for that matter debt markets open or open only to a very few maybe we're one of those few but we've had discussions with financial parties who are in participating with us on acquisitions and much like we've done in our history you know we'll bring in parties at the right time to look at buying assets and we're gonna maintain a very healthy leverage amount and um keep ourselves from getting into a distress no matter where we are in the cycle so i think we're just gonna see more and more opportunities and and we'll figure out how we and finance those and make sure we keep our balance sheet clean okay thanks for the comments thank you our next question comes from the line of neil dingman with true securities please proceed with your question morning all robert um first question on that also on that same line on twenty one expectations and i'm just wondering you know why i realize these plan really i think you know at least the ones you've just initial laid out it seems no new wells really what's what i'm just wondering what's driving is low cost or another way maybe ask is how you think about maintenance capex you know given just so low because um you know if i recall i thought frank already had you all cancel those country clubs and other memberships i just know what else is there uh yes there's no country club memberships uh up here um you know i mean the the eleven wells we have are in really good areas and they uh they will help keep production relatively flat at thirty million dollars now is that sustainable absolutely not um you know we still have a relatively high decline rate uh and it does depend on when we brought those wells online if we wait until the very end of twenty one um we're gonna have a hard time keeping production relatively flat um if we brought 'em on today you know we might have the same problem because we get all this flush production from these new wells so um you know may to maintain you know thirteen thousand b o e a day kind of level longer term we're gonna have to have a rig running and a one rig program i don't know what it would exactly cost us today but generally speaking is a hundred twenty million to maybe a hundred forty million depending on lateral length and working interest and things like that so you know this is just a very preliminary if the world stays the same and we're at forty ish low forty dollar environment not spend any drilling capital um these eleven ducks will help us keep production flat okay and then you kind of hit on my last one just on how do you think about sort of pdp decline you know on on on a go for it is now that you've been slowing a bit is that that too you know going to go down or i mean i guess look at another way is that you know you're able to give us kind of how many how many wells would offset that i mean anyway you can kind of give us a color on how you know kind of you're thinking about that in twenty one on broader terms uh yeah i think we've been consistent in telling everyone that our sort of based decline starting today we'll call it you know is about thirty percent in the first year and then it gets into the mid to maybe twenty six or twenty seven percent the next year and then low twenties or high teens after that and so uh you know i don't think that's changed any uh and if we didn't spend any capital then you can kind of forecast what our blow down um production would look like uh even if we didn't do those eleven wells but again with those eleven wells it'll help keep twenty one flat and then going forward in twenty two and beyond it's all gonna depend on price very good thanks guys thank you erin next question comes from line as jeff grant with northland capital markets please proceed with your question all right guys um i was wondering uh robert or or maybe from mark how important do you guys use thanks for cash flow positive in the context of evaluating um you know whether to go after the deduction and potentially drilling or i guess some point in time would you view that as kind of a um you know a a month if you will or would you guys have any level of comfort with any you know near medium term outstand uh it could help you know if the returns were good and it would help kinda you know jumpstart a return to growth sure maybe i'll i'll try to answer that one then robert can add on if he wants to you know we keep things pretty simple at the of the day we feel like our responsibility is to make good individual decisions at the wellhead um and that's why we were quick to put the rig down and stop completing and march in april is because the economics make a whole lot of and then did the ducks make sense right now i mean economically you definitely could go complete the ducks right now and uh have pretty nice uh irrs for the incremental cost to complete 'em um in terms of are we so focused so on quarter to quarter year to year pre-cash flow that we won't outspend no we're not and from a practical matter and we're just gonna be pre-cashflow positive this year and next year kind of irrespective of anything else that happens with prices if all we're doing is completing the ducks um at some point you know we we do anticipate picking the ring back up and uh you know there's a bit of a obviously a lag there between the cost you expend to drilling the complete wells versus the cash flow you know does that mean over the course of the year we're not pre-cashflow positive no not necessarily um but we're not so fixated on checking that box every quarter we wanna make smart economic decisions of the wellhead that will low into the bigger picture uh and having some outspent for some period of time um you know we still think is supported by the economics uh at the same time you know we're we're not ones just to go keep doing it completing because we have hedges in place or for other reasons we're just trying to to be as get a steward as we can of of the individual decisions we're making um at the wall head yeah the only thing i'll add jeff is i think we can run a one rate program with the level pretty action and cash flow we have today and be cash flow neutral on an annualized basis obviously there's a jump starting the program we're gonna be cash flow negative for a period of time but i think longer term over a your timeframe uh again depending on what the price is sure understood i appreciate those comments and my followup um and you guys still have um you know a decent amount of non-op exposure uh in the are you guys seeing any activity levels there and more on the land side is there any traction or conversations on swapping any of that out to increase the operated exposure there still working on the trades uh but people have been hunkered down in the bunker you know for quite some time now since you know at least march um and so nothing's moving very quickly there uh we have no we have not heard anything different from our partners in terms of activity in the near term being kind of the remainder of this year so we'll have to see as we get closer to year end what their view might be for activity in twenty twenty one all right thanks guys thank you our next question comes from line of <unk> with johnson race please receive your question morning robert um morning check had a uh quick question over on the balance sheet you know y'all are doing a great job in the free cash outlook looks great paint it down i'm wondering you know if you've been in conversations with the bank as we head into the fall redetermination you have back in march y'all were early and getting it done in the spring but you know um back in back then it looked like things would be pretty dire again in the fall and it's not as bad here and particularly with the line of study i'll have on the free cash kind of have any conversations with them to give you an any indication as to what uh the fall redetermination could could look like sure i mean probably too early to you know certainly anything around numbers uh but we do pretty rarely talk to banks and we do that normal course irrespective of the environ um you know the one thing i'd say i mean for us we are expecting a decrease in the barn base and you know obviously we're not drilling and completing new wells and hedges roll off um you know fortunately we feel like we've got enough ability to pay down debt to out pay that decrease and really you know we don't see any scenarios that we think are realistic that would be concerning in that regard now i will say like does environment feel better now than it did three months ago absolutely uh and and maybe some of that's the shock of seeing minus thirty seven hour oil and uh you know teen realizations for for the months of april and may um at the end of the day it's still out of our a good price environment for for companies in general and the banks um maybe they feel a little better because we're at forty five dollars or forty two dollars versus somewhere in teens but they still have a lot of issues to do through to to deal with it and obviously there's been a lot of the mp companies that have gone bankrupt and there's certainly more that will so the banks still have their hands full and they're still working through all these situations yeah i i think there is a lot trepidation on the banks part in general um and yeah i don't frankly see them letting up a whole bunch in the fall no no that being said that's a general statement um you know we've got one time leverage and look literally and generally are viewed as having done the right thing from a financial standpoint and and our assets are better than than than many we probably feel like we've got a pretty supportive bank group that um is gotta be reasonable and fair and and historically that's been the case um but too early to to circle a number thanks mark um and then i guess just from my follow-up you know robert you get some some really good time and y'all did some pretty creative things to get louie down um in the second quarter i know you talked about how it's gonna come back up a little bit here in the back after the year towards the you know from more historical range but you know any of those um initiatives that you took do you think that you could can carry for award um to kind of help mitigate that uh fellow recruits uh it's definitely done there's there's you know it's just a constant progression of a well life cycle to adjust uh rfp to lift uh a lot of our wells are on uh gas lift so relatively expensive compressors uh over time that gets changed out to other lift methods in some cases rod pump and other cases plunger lift um what have you so um we're continuing to work through that and that will definitely help reduce oe and then some of the things that you know we we uh we're fortunate in getting done in the quarter uh working with the utility company to get meters set and get ahead of the schedule there or got moved up in the schedule from some good relationships we uh we ended up getting generators off of our payroll and those are very very expenses so we didn't have a whole lot but they still show up as a big expense so some of these things we did in the second quarter uh are sustainable and we'll continue doing the right things in the way we you know operate our business and continue to watch costs like a hawk all right thank you all very much and uh you guys have a strong quarter and a strong outlook thank you thanks john thank you ladies since i'm gonna remind you if you'd like to join the question please press star one on your telephone keypad our next question comes from the line of no parts with coker and palmer please proceed with your question hey good morning i know i um you know i was thinking about the having the the back inventory that you know where it works out that just completing those next year can help you keep production flat that's you know that's a lot of really great um flexibility you have there and and i mean was that just sort of a um a result of the the timing of everything you know kind of falling off the rails with with covid and oak russia or was um was that sort of part of the plan as you were just trying to you know continue to pivot to to emphasis on free cash flow heading in next year uh i'd love to tell you no all that we had this great plan that no matter what happened in the world oil going into twenty or sub twenty that we could keep production flat for three years running with various amounts of capital um if you go back and think about the beginning of the year and the call we had uh you know related to the fourth quarter earnings and full year um we had a one rate program we were gonna average for the entire year a tiny bit of free cash flow um and those eleven wells would've been completed uh i don't know if i can't remember but pretty darn close so um i'd say it's a fall out of what's happened here uh and just being very conservative with our capital expenditures and and cash and making sure that you know we come out of this down this near term down cycle we've been in a down cycle since two thousand fourteen but at least this recent uh piece of it uh that we you know we survive nicely through it and come out the other side and um can continue to uh find ways to consolidate and grow great thanks and you know just a a housekeeping question sorry if you touched on this earlier and i i missed it um for the free cashflow calculation if i looked at the numbers right it looked like this is one of those periods where there was a pretty big delta between i guess you'd say cash capex and you know uh sort of capex incurred in the quarter and i was just wondering um for the free cash flow calculation going forward um um you know just kind of which which which one of those is more important for us to use as we um you know just just try to model that we always use a crew cash from a calculation standpoint because not all the bills necessarily have hit but we know what generally they are so okay it's in the presentation on the last page or something like that okay so so real oh and um one other thing i um and i i just don't have at least in front of me and as far as changing working capital you that's something else you would routinely um include well in of the impact of in a free cash calculation or or would you exclude that yeah so we don't include that and and a recognize there's you know multiple different ways to look at that i mean the way we've been approached it is okay adjusted eva x is the the best proxy for it really sort of cash flow for the period uh we back out interest expense and then we back out capital expenditures for activity during that period now when you're stopping or starting there is gonna be a bigger delta between calculating pre-capture the way we do versus if you're using a cash cap x number um you know the the second quarter was very atypical from the standpoint of you know here we're reporting thirty five million of free cash flow you know our debt balance went up um and the reason for that is because and of course this is tied to the cash back back it's just the time of the payments you know we reduced the the negative working cap the working capital deficit by about fifty million during the quarter uh now we're to a point where that working deficit work capital deficit is pretty low and probably won't fluctuate a whole bunch one way or the other until we take that to to be back up uh at which point you'd expect uh you know as you start completions and drilling again you start getting bills but there's some lag between the activity and when you get the bills and when you pay them um so very typical quarter yeah as we mentioned the press release you know we had about a hundred sixty nine million debt at quarter end and the month of july we we paid down a little more than fourteen um that's not the run rate by the way it's not fourteen million quarter that was high because of timing but we you expect um i mean really every month this year that we're paying down some debt um without any big changes in the working capital status great thanks a lot for the details thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i'll turn the floor back to mr anderson for any final comments well we appreciate everybody uh joining us and uh you know we'll uh continue to update as uh as we need to and uh we'll see you next uh quarter thanks thank you this concludes today's conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation yeah yeah
