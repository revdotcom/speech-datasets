officer dense splicerona thank you john and thank all of you for joining us today we hope that you and your families remain safe and healthy to start the call i would love to acknowledge two groups

to to position the company for the future and finally i review the company's near term priorities as we navigate the current environment as expected our second quarter results reflect the major changes in the market the quarter began with significant governmental actions resulting in the shutdown of dental practices and restrictions on patient traffic the situation improved across the quarter with month to month improvements in terms of dentist offices opening and patients beginning to come back our revenue followed this trend our team continues to track patient attitudes around returning to the dental office as well as the ongoing impact of additional infection control requirements on office capacity based on what we are seeing we are optimistic that the recovery is well underway globally our results in the quarter also reflect significant actions the company took to address the difficult operating environment these plans were built around employee safety meeting the needs of the customer enhancing the financial strength of the company and making continued progress on our key strategic initiatives to date we've seen good results around employee safety and have not seen any major disruptions across the organization just by challenges presented by the pandemic the company has been able to reliably meet customer demand our commercial team showed excellent creativity and adapting to new circumstances providing an extensive array of digital clinical education and online marketing events these programs have been extremely well received a comprehensive cost control program was executed during the second quarter involving furloughs short work weeks salary reductions and spending controls these efforts contributed to the drop in sgna expenses in the quarter while the business has begun to restart this program will remain in place until the trajectory of the recovery is better understood our supply chain has been disciplined around inventory and there has been a real emphasis on protecting our cash flow finally the company undertook a series of actions to bolster its liquidity and financial position while there is a pressing need to manage the disruptions caused by the pandemic our team is focused on positioning the company for the future since announcing a restructuring in late twenty eighteen dense platform has made significant progress against the goals we had laid out our work on continuously challenging ourselves has shown there is still for our opportunities to improve our performance therefore today we are announcing additional portfolio actions that expand on the original program these include plans for exiting the traditional orthodontics business as well as parts of our analog glad business i will discuss details later in the call these steps well difficult allow the company to focus on higher growth and higher margin digital areas where we believe dense plus erona has strategic advantage moving to slide seven where we summarize our two q twenty results second quarter revenues where four hundred ninety one million down fifty percent on an organic basis due to the impact of the coronavirus adjusted operating income was negative non-cap eps for the quarter was a loss of eighteen cents cash flow was actively managed in the second quarter driving cash flow from operations of a hundred seventy five million which was up twenty one percent compared to prior year i will now turn the call over to jorge who will review the quarter of the results and provide an outlook thank you don and good morning everyone the second quarter was obviously a challenging one for the global economy and for many industries including dental on a slide nine we show our second quarter non gap twenty twenty pnl starting with the top line organic sales were down fifty percent as compared to the prior year in the us and europe with some minor exceptions dental practices limited their activity to emergency procedures in april and much of may and then began to reopen as we moved into june as we share on our last earnings call we saw the clients of sixty to eighty percent in april in certain geographies with the us been hit the hardest but our revenue trends improved gradually each month finishing down about the forty percent compared to prior year in june we also saw a gradual improvement from the first to the last week in june so it is clear that we are seeing a recovery but have yet to get back to a normal level of sales cross profit was two hundred and seven million or forty two point one percent of sales down from fifty seven point seven percent in the prior year quarter as it is the case in solid and material reductions in volume gross profit margin is impacted by the fixed cost base which is difficult to address in the short term examples of this cost include depreciation leases maintenance of manufacturing and logistic facilities and cost related to ensuring compliance with high manufacturing standards gross profit margin was also impacted by higher than average inventory reserve expenses of approximately seventeen million primarily as a result of lower sales sgna of two hundred forty nine million was down as substantial a hundred thirty two million which is approximately thirty five percent lower as compared to prior year during the quarter we took the site of action to reduce our sgna cost resulted in the steep year over year decline one area and sgna that actually increased over last year was bad that expense which saw an up take of fifteen million year over year this significant pnl situations were driven by the ongoing market disruptions and generated an operating loss of forty two million in the quarter last year our operating profit was to two million in the second quarter interest and order increased by nine point nine million versus last year driven by the issuance of seven hundred fifty million in long term debt the addition of new credit facility and the termination of certain fx hedges the non gap tax rate was twenty seven point five percent in the quarter up from twenty five point three percent in the prior year a function of the change in the f tomated amount of free tax income and it changed to the expected income mix known gap eps was a loss of eighteen cents as compared to known gap eps of sixty six cents in the prior year quarter moving on to slide ten where we review our consumable segment performance reported sales were a hundred eighty seven million down fifty eight point six percent and down fifty seven point seven percent on an organic sales basis all of our product groups in consumers were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of dental offices while our consumer sales show a deeper decline than our t and e sales both segments actually perform relatively similar from an end customer perspective let me explain the two factors that contributed to the larger decline in our consumable sales first there's a difference in order late times consumer delivers tend to match demand almost simultaneously up or down due to the nature of the products t and e has a longer order late time and therefore delivers continued over an extended period even after dental procedure volume is slow down at the beginning of the quarter the second factor impacted consumer will more than t and e is fluctuations in inventory levels in the dealer network during severe market conditions it is typical for companies to preserve cash by lower inventory balances as much as possible we saw as deeper decline in consumers network inventory so when you account for all of these variables we believe both segments decline at relatively similar levels consumers operating margin was negative nine point four percent as compared to twenty seven percent in the second quarter of twenty nineteen there are two primary reasons for the decline in consumers margins the first reason is that the consumerable segment experience is deeper fall off in sales compared to t and e second the consumable business is more plant and infrastructure dependent and requires more volume to run efficiently we have more manufacturing plants dedicated to consumables and this means a higher fixed infrastructure cost for this segment this is why we have been taking steps to consolidate our footprint and reduce our fixed cost base in the past couple of years we have completed several portfolio shaping action including phone one eight hundred dentist c cat and the surgical business of wellspect in addition the two portfolio shaping activities we are announcing today will further consolidate our manufacturing for print and will increase productivity and decrease fixed costs moving on to slide eleven where we highlight our technologies and equipment segment net sales were three hundred four million down forty five point six percent as compared to prior year organic sales for the quarter we're down forty three point six percent versus the prior year equipment and instruments digital dentistry and implants all experienced similar levels of decline in the quarter driven by the lower sales resulting from covid nineteen our healthcare business so it's like decline in q2 after posting a strong q1 as healthcare systems we're getting ready for the first major where of covid nineteen acknowledge and equipment operating income margin was negative one point three percent versus seventeen point two percent in the prior year quarter on slide twelve we share our business performance for the second quarter on original basis us sales of a hundred thirty one million decline sixty point three percent compared to the prior year this represents a decline in organic sales of sixty percent in the us market consumables decline is slightly more than t and e european sales were two hundred fifteen million down forty nine percent compared to the prior year organic sale were down forty six point nine percent versus last year in europe consumable sales decline more than technologies and equipment on a percentage basis rest of the world sales were a hundred forty four million down forty four percent on organic sales we're down forty one point nine percent rest of the world consumers decline more than ten sales in the same in the second quarter when it's like thirteen and we show our cashflow performance in the second quarter of twenty twenty cashflow from operations was a hundred seventy five million as compared to a hundred forty five million into prior year quarter this strong cashflow duration was the result of a discipline approach to curtailing expenses and reducing working capital without sacrificing key strategic investments working capital generated a significant boost in liquidity in the quarter we were successful in achieving meaningful reductions in accounts receivables and inventory balances we expect some of this cash will be injected back into working capital as demand and production volumes client back up to normal levels in terms of capital expenditures we spent thirteen million in the second quarter of twenty twenty down from twenty seven million last year free cash flow was a strong hundred sixty two million in the quarter up thirty seven percent as compared to a hundred eighteen million in the prior year in the quarter we pay twenty two million individuals for a total of a hundred eighty four million return to shareholders through dividends and share purchases in the first six months of twenty twenty at the end of june twenty twenty we had a strongly query available comprising one point one billion of cash and one point two billion of committed trade facilities the efforts we made during the second quarter ensure that we have ample liquidity available to invest and grow the company as the economy recovers when it's like fourteen i'd like to talk about the significant actions we took to reduce operating expenses in the second quarter of twenty twenty our efforts to reduce costs in the quarter we're multifaceted all levels and functions of the inner price contributed to significant compensation savings each part of the organization up to and including the board of directors and executive levels is step up and help in this efforts as of today most of our employees who are impacted by these measures have returned to work or to normal pay levels the next largest area for cost reductions was discretionary commercial spend such as advertising and promotions it was logical to reduce this spend when dental offices were closed and the returns could not be realized we also achieve significant savings from reductions in professional services and of course travel expenses to get all of these actions deliver a reduction in sgna of thirty five percent versus last year with respect to business transfer the remainder of the year i like to make a few comments first let me start with current volume trends all regions recover from their low point in april and improved by twenty to forty percentage points by the end of the quarter additionally in june the last week of the month was sign technically better than the first week and we are pleased to note that the positive momentum continues into july with july sale approaching or surpassing twenty nineteen levels depending on the region and product groups there are still some gating factors in place including the availability of personal protection equipment new infection prevention protocols reducing office capacity and overlapping regulations all of which impact they shape up the recovery together this factors point to a gradual as we post with southern it's not back in demand let me give you more details from a geographical perspective in the us virtually all dental offices are now open and we continue to see signs of improvement with july volume trending better than what we saw in june in europe we also saw july trend improvement sequentially with regards to the rest of the world in apac some of the markets turned positive in july with good traction in china and japan and some lingering concerns in australia latin america remains a challenging market as covid nineteen continues to impact our business in brazil and our countries in the region moving forward to a second half of the year as we announced today we are accelerating actions to fund growth areas and improve efficiencies as we did in q2 we will continue to drive a discipline resource allocation process that emphasizes return investment and sustainability of our growth initiatives with that i will now turn the call back to del thanks jorge and moving to slide seventeen as i mentioned earlier in the call in november twenty eighteen we put a plan in place to accelerate growth improve margins and simplify the organization our results through twenty nineteen in the first quarter of twenty twenty show significant progress the execution highlights of our plan include accelerating growth behind new products including prime scan and prime mill as well as other new products in our consumable portfolio the pipeline of future new products has also been enhanced the company has made major investments in critical areas like our digital product portfolios digital commercial capabilities and growth priorities like our shore smile clear aligner business okay dense supply serena has implemented a new organizational structure centralizing supply chain and other functions while creating a unified commercial structure there have been major initiatives designed to transform the finance hr in it areas further we've undertaken multiple portfolio shaping activities including the ones announced today the restructuring plan is a multi-year initiative as part of that the organization has embraced the need to continue challenging ourselves to go beyond the original plan and deliver better results that work has shown there are significant opportunities in both the near term and longer term moving now to slide eighteen over the last several quarters as jorge mentioned we have exited several underperforming businesses these reduce our cost and complexity while serving to enhance our growth and margins the team continually reviews all our businesses against a frame work around future growth opportunities as well as strategic fit in the area of orthodontics we believe that the clear aligner space is an attractive opportunity for dense plus arona sure smile now offers a comprehensive digital treatment plan that the positions the company well in this rapidly growing market going forward we will focus all our efforts in the ortho space on the clear aligner area we believe this offers the opportunity to grow innovate and take advantage of many of and supply cerrone's unique strategic advantages including our large sac user community as a result we are exiting the traditional orthodontics business which includes brackets bands tubes and wires the traditional orthodontic business is a component of the technology and equipment segment and has had net sales of approximately a hundred and thirty two million in twenty nineteen likewise in our lab business there's a clear opportunity to focus on the digital a space which is showing good growth rates and solid margins it is a place where innovation will be rewarded based on our analysis it is critical to focus all our lab resources in the digital area going forward as such we are announcing plans to exit the analog portion of the laboratory business that manufacture removeable dentures and related products this business is a component of the consumable segment and had net sales of approximately forty four million in twenty nineteen together the portfolio shaping initiatives and additional actions are expected to result in the closure of several facilities and an incremental reduction of approximately six to seven percent of the company's workforce by the end of twenty twenty one <unk> the ongoing execution of the restructuring will enhance dense supply sarone's continued efforts to grow revenues expand our margins and simplify the organization wide nineteen lists our priorities for the back half of twenty twenty they in executing on our comprehensive restructuring plan pursuing our growth initiatives aggressively and meeting our financial objectives in conclusion the covid pandemic will continue to impact our industry and our company for foreseeable future current trends are positive and a reason for optimism but we will need to continue to adapt to the circumstances as they change we believe we have a comprehensive plan for both the short term and longer term to deliver value for our customers and our shareholders further the company has maintained its focus on our priorities around growth margin expansion and simplifying the business our financial strength broad portfolio and global reach our position as well to succeed and win in the dental industry it's hard to know what the new normal is or when it will arrive but our internal theme is that teeth do not heal themselves our team is optimistic about the fundamentals of the industry and we embrace the current challenges and are confident in our strategy our customers and our team thank you and with that we'll take questions thank you and ladies and gentleman if you have a question at this time just for stop then want to get in the queue to withdraw your question simply press the pound or hash please stand by what we compile the q and a roster our first question is from jeff johnson with bear please go ahead thank you good morning guys can you hear me okay i think i was on mute there yeah we we we got yeah great good morning so donna i think i just wanna start with the july comments i really wanna understand a message that you want to have out there uh it sounds like you could make the argument that july was getting back towards flatish year over year levels according to what jorge said um but how much of that might be selling that was recovering on uh some selling issues earlier in the quarter or earlier in two q uh does your selling is it starting to match kind of the sell out at this point and again i know you're not guiding but the three q should we think july maybe isn't sustainable as you get in august and september is if there is some backlog in helping in that july number thanks yeah thanks jeff um you know look i think corey said it clearly in the prepared remarks as we were as as we're looking at july there's places that have of uh you know we're seeing good progress in in some cases it's actually exceeding nineteen your specific question about how much of that is you know inventory rebuild um you know it's hard to see exactly there's a couple things we're looking at and you know that's that's one of the reasons we're not being okay let's just go project july into august september and later in the fourth quarter the things we're looking at is patient volume and we've seen that as good office capacity uh we see office capacity kind of improving our our patient tracking is telling us that uh you know confidence in the dentist office continues to go up but there is a pocket that's gonna be reluctant at least in the us to go back for a little while and what that in our mind means that okay uh look if if we're getting capacity in the in the dentist office back to you know close to normal that's gonna take a little bit of time i i think we're working through a bowl of patients right now uh and then i think you know from an inventory perspective our dealers and the dentist's office ultimately are working through the fact that uh you know when when the pandemic started i think people hit the brakes pretty hard on stuff that's ordered almost every day and in our mind that's kind of the consumable space and you could see jeff the difference between our consumable and technology you know the t and e side uh and we believe that is a lot to do with okay uh we don't know how long the office is gonna be closed you know we're gonna stop building inventory on the daily stuff and as a result there may be some build back here um but look i i in my summary i was pretty clear on saying hey look we we're happy that we saw you know consecutive month to month sequential improvement in overall demand we're seeing that at the retail level we're happy that july has continued that trend and we're happy to see that in you know some cases you know we're at actually tracking better than twenty nineteen understood that's helpful thanks dan and just as a follow up you know thinking about twenty twenty one conceptually uh you know we all know what the ada saying about uh high likelihood that uh dental consumption and and dental industry wide revenues are down relative to twenty nineteen levels uh i don't think anybody would really argue with that at least looking at things right now uh but with some of the extra restructuring efforts you're taking now some of the tailwinds from the restructuring uh that would probably still continuing from the past plan you know how how do you think about the margins especially next year can they get back to twenty nineteen levels with revenue that at least is approaching twenty nineteen levels next year or or is there a lag in kind of the margin recovery relative to how we think about uh revenues next year thanks yeah jeff it's it's early for us to really forecast twenty twenty one uh i i would tell you the steps we took around the restructuring the rips act our interest in sitting there saying hey look we need to get back on the margin progression i mean you know we've we've been saying since november twenty eighteen how do we grow how do we get our margins improving and i think we have to take uh organizational steps to do i think the results uh here show you that you know we we think we've made some good progress i mean you know basically through the first quarter of twenty twenty we were tracking on a margin basis and you know what we've seen uh obviously our origin is revenue dependent and you know hey look if if revenue is down twenty percent in twenty twenty one that's obviously gonna have an impact on the business we don't think that's gonna happen but we are taking specific steps now to sit there and say irregardless of of you know whether the category is up two or three or down two or three or you know up ten down ten we want to be taking steps toward margin creation and you know as we get out of the traditional ortho business we get out we got out of the analog lab those are all part of the ongoing restructuring designed to help us really take charge of our ability to drive margin creation going forward and i'm not gonna say it's gonna be revenue independent but we think we can take steps you know at a certain revenue base that we're really gonna be able to drive margin and you know we we were very clear uh you know i i joke with john sweeney occasionally that uh we we picked our revenue targets to match the years just to make sure that we could always communicate it so we've always said twenty two in twenty twenty two you know uh and internally what we're trying to focus on is look we we think twenty two is as attainable we don't know if it's gonna happen exactly on the trajectory based on what we're seeing with uh covid you know is covid and the uh knock on effects of that is that a six month issue it's a nine months it's a twelve month issue but we wanna be marching back toward that target it just may take us a little bit longer to get there thank you thank you thank you and our next question comes from tyco person with jp morgan just go ahead hey um are you able to talk about how much of the consumable pressure in the quarter would inventory d stocking versus slower orders and and how much incremental risk is they're going forward with distributors uh around potential additional d stocking uh been more <unk> this is <unk> it is uh and it it's hard to um give a any precise number but as as done just indicated uh in the case of consumables uh there is a the the the order lead time is very short and so uh when depend educate uh customers and and dealers and in general in the in the marketplace there was a a reaction to uh to manage inventory very very closely and uh when we look at the data of uh retail sales in our sales uh there there are a lot of indications that show that uh there was a reduction in the inventory levels that uh we historically or typically uh uh carry in the network so uh there were an element of that and um when that comes back to uh to typical levels is is hard to uh to project uh some of that may be happening as uh as not indicated uh but i don't think that is uh something that uh for us um is going to be uh meaningful from a long term perspective listen at the end of the day we always want to uh make sure that our sales match retail sales that that is that is our key objective that's how we we make money uh there will be always uh small fluctuations in the network up so i think in given the magnitude of the changes that we experience in the second quarter as a result of lower revenues and um uncertainty that we still have in in many places i think that is uh that that noise is not actually meaningful in terms of explaining our performance and our you know trajectory over the next several months okay and then down on the portfolio reshaping i'm curious you know the decision to exit ortho i i always thought part of the pitch on the clear liner was you know the ability to go in and do hybrid cases and and you know leverage that you know strong ortho channel as you push push out of church also i'm curious if you know if there's risk of the synergies here um and and how do you think about that yeah thanks taco um we're we're actually there's a component of the you know the wire bending aspect of of short smile that we're keeping um what when we say we kind of delineate traditional ortho it's kind of the bracket spans that would go straight up on a orthodont an orthodontist using orthodontia uh the the we believe hybrid is meaningful we believe that it's it's a differentiator for sure smile so we we're actually keeping those components so that piece of traditional ortho and the piece that actually came with the er metrics acquisition is gonna stay with that and then you know what we're seeing is where we're getting real traction on suresmile tends to be uh you know right now focused around our sarah base um you know we kind of made that shift uh at basically in october of last year and that's part of the the one ds program and we're seeing good traction there so as we look going forward we didn't feel that there were gonna be disenergies associated with getting out of traditional uh you know orthodontia treatment among the orthodontist uh group so uh you know as we focus on growing in the future you know we tend to think all right how do we take care of how do we take advantage of our digital assets and and how do we really look at expanding in in places that uh are not necessarily tied to kind of the traditional or the model okay and then just lastly any thoughts on just the capital equipment appetite as we think about the back half of the year and then think about you know prime scan and prime mill can you just talk on to what degree you think there there could be pent up demand in any need on your part to be little bit more flexible in terms of financing or pricing potentially um you know it it's been interesting like even before the pandemic hit we were really beginning to shift to one you know our theory of one visit dentistry and we prime mill and the speed of prime mill it really made that a reality i mean you can get patients in and out with a single unit crown and and you know an hour plus um so we we had made that shift and it was interesting in in april when everything went down we really it to a bunch of digital uh whether it was debt product demonstrations or you know kind of taking people through what one visit dentistry really means and we've got a pretty good reception so what we've seen uh to date and and you've actually seen the results that there's a pretty good appetite uh in our mind for technology and equipment now whether it's spread across you know are we gonna see treatment centers and are we gonna see imaging not sure but we we feel very good about prime scan and prime mill and the opportunity need for dentists who are you know basically gonna be dealing with a patient population that may be a little bit hey do i want to go to the dentist three times in in you know during the pandemic to get a crown fixed or can i get that done one time you're so seeing a lot of dentists that we've been talking to when we've been seeing a fair amount of success um with saying hey look i gotta change how i practice and they use the kind of the downtime during the pandemic to think through that so we're uh we feel good about where we are from a technology and equipment space in the back half and a large part it's due to the first of the new products we pushed out but also the change in messaging and how we're pitching the pitching these products so ultimately and you know look we're working with our dealer partners globally right now to to make sure that we're helping dentists access this material uh yeah but we're do i do i see a whole bunch of pricing pressure and and you know crazy financing options coming on our technology and equipment no okay thank you thanks tyco thank you and our next question comes from student <unk> with bart please go ahead great thanks good morning everybody so a couple quick questions for you you know first you're coming around july being a fairly flat year beer on a global basis is obviously pretty positive and now you don't wanna give any specific guidance but just kind of eyeball in this three consensus estimates for the third quarter uh they call for revenues to be down some twenty to twenty five percent year over year so i'm just wondering based on what you're seeing in july and you know barring any other major changes in the the landscape is that you know is that a number that seems like maybe that's too conservative on the revenue outlook as far as we're consensus i was just curious to get your thoughts around that dave good morning we're here um listen it is it is early for us to uh be able to extrapolate um from the july numbers and as you can appreciate uh there is a lot of uh different data points coming from uh different regions and uh there are some markets that are doing much better in terms of the number of offices that are open markets that are good from a volume perspective we still have lingering concerns in places like australia parts of latin america and there are some spots in europe that are also still challenging so it it is it is very hard to um make a judgment with respect to uh to those numbers i think uh what we are what we are really encouraged by the fact that sequentially the last three months have in you moving in the right direction but from a planning perspective uh internally we we are we are trying to we continue to work with scenario planning we we are uh preparing the company for for a multiple set of outcomes in the next uh in the next few months and quarters i think is a brilliant thing to do so um hard to tell you uh if if that number is right or not okay that's helpful one other quick clarification question on the exiting of the traditional orthodontics in parts of the a analog lab business are these businesses that could be monetized through asset sales or are these just full shutdowns maybe just give us a little more color around the decision tree on shutdown versus asset sale yes the um you know as we look at it right now we're we're making the announcement uh to get it done obviously we'll look to dispose the assets in a way that it's most beneficial to the company if uh you know there's some asset sales we'll certainly look at it if it's a full shutdown uh you know we we gave you guys the the numbers based on you know the worst case scenario and obviously we're gonna work to improve that um but but again the process because you know we mentioned in the prepared remarks it's multiple plants in multiple locations you know obviously you start with the works council and and and you go through a lot of different things but you know the the numbers we gave you represent uh you know the base case and and we're gonna work hard to improve versus that and there is the opportunity to to do better than what we said okay all right appreciate the extra color thanks thanks steve thank you our next question is from michael attorney with bank of america please go ahead good morning and thanks for the questions i want to just dive back into the slide um come terry specifically i apologize to keep <unk> on this but i just wanna make sure this is clear as possible <unk> are you saying that what you have and so far in july on a total dollar basis across the book is similar to two thousand nineteen is there any way specifically to think about how that's factoring into the us in particular in terms of the the the quantity of dollar basis versus some of the other growth rates where there might be some countries that did not have any meaningful covid spikes that could be growing clearly a faster clip yeah uh michael thanks for the question we are still trying to digest all the july numbers uh there's a lot of uh a lot of data to look at from a product perspective from a geography perspective uh as i as i indicated before uh july definitely trends better than june um so that that that that is very good uh but it is uh it depends on the region it depends on the on the geography and at this and on the products at this point i can't give you a breakdown um but because uh there's some some analytics that we still need to do overall um the uh the the total portfolio is is getting closer to uh nineteen numbers and in some instances uh it did better than uh than twenty nineteen and uh and and that is uh definitely a substantially improvement uh versus versus june and then just one more question and on aligners how do you think about differentiation strategy that you're gonna go forward with i know a lot of it was tied historically to the integration you had um with omnicam and with and with sarah and everything and as you think of about where you compete you know every aligner seems to have its own specific angle on what makes it better where do you think that sher smile will shake out is what makes it better or the best or what x-ray's an office differentiate than everyone else yeah thanks michael i i would say that's our system um look between omni and prime scan uh you know we think we've got a pretty good install base uh we we have a very loyal user group there that is looking to practice at the highest level of their license so when we can add something that's integrated and seamless like shore smile into into the package and particularly you know when we came out with uh shore smile seven point six uh it it it's really seamlessly integrated uh into you know our base uh digital assets it it becomes really easy to use and you know we feel with seven point six you know we're now able to compete across the broad broad portfolio a class one plus two plus three uh we we think that our treatment planning uh software is second to none i mean we feel it's really really competitive and um you know we're very comfortable with the clinical results we're seeing and as we go into uh you know kind of our install base we feel very good about that right now um and and look every single day uh we get better and better at beginning to think about dense supply serena not as as individual product companies where we're sitting there saying hey we're gonna go sell you an omni we're gonna go sell you a prime and then oh by the way maybe next week somebody will come in with sure smile no it's it's really we've begun to focus much more on how do we uh focus on the customer as as one company and and as part of that one company approach stuff like uh ds one uh you know one ds excuse me we really are going in and saying hey look how do you think about using these digital assets to you know make life easier around doing orthodontics with clear liners how do you really think about implants differently and and again we're we're working hard to actually bring this idea that that we're the dental solutions company to reality does that answer your question sir yes michael we lost you and i was still here thanks thanks for the color thank you and our next question is from jason <unk> with five percent please go ahead good morning uh thanks for taking the questions here uh <unk> uh thanks for all the rich arching plan color uh one in the orthodontic business i mean you've you've mentioned here a few times leveraging the sarah constall base with clear aligners uh i think this makes a ton of sense but i mean should we interpret your sarah comments to be that you're you're gonna be emphasizing a short smile principally in the gp channel where do you have a strategy to continue to target the orthodontist channel that doesn't have that same sarah owner base yeah um look we we we're happy to take your smile into the orthodontist's office and the gp office you know we we're seeing is again we wanna play to our strengths and we we do have a large install base and when we do programs like one ds uh where you know we're we're obviously trying to package uh you know workflows together in such a way that we're there's real benefit to the dentist we're seeing more success there so look we will continue to pitch uh short smile across both the orthodontic orthodontic as well as the gp channel um we think we've got more innate advantages in the in the gp channel right now that's helpful okay and then i want to ask actually a new product question here and actually partial related to the prior question so i appreciate it's policy here not to discuss new products before they're officially launched but instead of talking specifically to of recently improved large field of view imaging system or maybe any 3d printing plans you might have prime print uh maybe you could talk to what you see in the in the market from an opportunity or demand perspective for each of those categories um each of large field of view and also in office through for me thanks uh on you know wide field of view we're filling a gap in our portfolio um that you know we it took us a little while to get there but we feel very good about that right now and if you look at what we've done with you know our ortho sl and our online uh and now wide field of view we we feel that we're very competitive in the imaging space and uh you know now in terms of what do we think about the macro demand uh for imaging equipment again you know if you look over the last six months and again the pandemic really started you know at the end of the first quarter and we've seen regions begin to recover you know we've seen good solid demand across the board and technology and equipment and you know it's when you start looking at things like wide field of view it it's really not necessarily about you know i'm just replacing my x-ray machinery it's it's what procedures do i want to do and you know wide field of view and and particularly when you start looking at 2d and 3d uh kind of imaging products it lets you do more procedures it lets you do better implants it lets you do better endo lets you do better orthodontious so um you know we we think that demand you know is it gonna generate a little bit as we recover from the pandemic it could but uh you know we've seen demand remain pretty solid on there and in in terms of of printing you know we we haven't really discussed that and you know look our our one of the challenges in in um in this space uh you know versus other med device spaces where you can really put your pipeline out uh you know we we tend to play things pretty close to the best what what i would tell you is that our new product portfolio work has been one of you know we kept saying in the prepared remarks you know we stayed focused on our key strategic initiatives well one of those is new products and um you know what we've been working on internally is how do we take the five to ten most important products whether that's in the endo implant or in the technology and equipment space and keep making progress on it and and we you know we're not backing off on what we think our launch schedule is on some of those major launch launches and you know again we think a position as well as as people come out of the pandemic all right thanks very much guys thanks jason thank you our next question is from elizabeth anderson with evercore please go ahead hi good morning guys um i just was wondering if we if you could help us put some numbers around the the new or the strategy um can you talk about um the you know maybe some comments about how you sell volumes trend within orthodontics and then also if anything you can talk about in turn of the size of the revenue base and or and or growth rates would be helpful just in terms of framing that opportunity on a go forward basis thank you yeah thanks elizabeth um you know it's funny we we we haven't broken out uh you know the total orthodunch business and we don't give uh the clear liner number specifically what i would tell you is that uh what we've seen uh over the last year is accelerating growth behind sure smile uh and and we've seen actually very positive trends even coming out of the pandemic so that's one of the reasons we feel very comfortable about that decision um look we we feel that uh dense place run has an opportunity to become a solid number two in the space and we're gonna work toward that um so you know can do some math around that uh look ultimately you know we we've been pretty consistent saying we want to grow and we want to do margin creations so the steps we're taking around getting out of the traditional ortho business and really focusing on clear liners helps us do that so you know our our bet and belief is that the clear liner space is gonna be a significant contributor to our aggregate growth rate over time okay perfect that's helpful and then you know given obviously you guys a pretty um substantial liquidity position right now how do you see that playing out if you sort of assume that you know hopefully were through the worst of covid and things continue to uh improve from here uh yeah good more and listen our our capital deployment philosophy is um are not changed and have not changed i think uh it was uh absolutely the right thing to uh raise more liquidity to uh be in a position of a strength from a financial standpoint uh we were encouraged actually by uh a number of shareholders to to be in that position which we totally agree with at this point we want to um keep doing what we're doing being very prudent with our balance sheet being very diligent with our k cash flow uh you probably noticed in the in the second quarter we had a very strong operating cash flow uh very good free cash flow and um all our parts of our deployment uh will you know are are not changing for now we paid our dividend um and we have no plans to change the dividend at this time once things go back to uh to a more uh normal level uh will reassess where we are at that point we will look at all of the uh the demands for capital uh opportunities that we have at that time and uh we'll make uh what are the decisions we think are in the best interest of our shareholders as we deploy that capital uh but for now i think the the focus is on on the recall is how uh to ensure that we have a very stable financial position uh how we are able to uh fund a strategic initiative some of which uh don has talked about that uh we want to make sure that even in a low revenue environment uh and low profitability environment we we we keep funding those initiatives and and that is one of the reasons we have uh we have that that that capital we want to keep investing in the organic growth of the company uh for the time being okay thank you very much that's helpful thank you thank you and our next question is from steve <unk> with wolf research please go ahead uh hi good morning and thanks for the time here uh i wanna ask one very specific and the one kind of big picture question um the specific one is actually about germany uh i wonder you know to what extent you'd be willing to talk about growth in germany operating conditions there uh and to what extent you think that's a good verb for you know what the business might look like over the next several months in the event that we get the virus under under control and then i have a follow-up on strategy after that that's thanks steve um you know conditions in germany are if you were gonna go around the world are pretty good um you know and again i think corey said it well it depends on the business and you know the there's been different reactions to different different businesses and and we kind of look at doc together which is you know germany uh switzerland and austria um but but conditions there if if that's a harbinger of the future uh would would tell you that uh you know things do get closer to normal i mean there's obviously you know again the same things we see over here that we keep tracking is what's office capacity you know around the new infection protocols and again that keeps getting better uh you know things are better in july than they were in june just as as the uh dentist and their staff get more used to that and then patient attitudes uh it's interesting the the uh the patient tracking that we did in germany showed uh that you know the from a pay perspective there was less change in germany than there was in the us around the pandemic so there seems to be a little bit more of a stable attitude toward visiting the dentist office so you know ultimately if if things look like germany it points to the fact that things do get back to normal okay much appreciate it and then john i wanted to to borrow from from your experience a little bit if i could you're a you're a med tech guy and you came into dental with a different perspective on you know what the industry could be and you know how businesses could run and covid has certainly changed you know some of that thinking i wonder as you you keep your med tech hat on and and you think about what you want the business to look like and you know how practice evolves you know over the next you know however many quarters or months and we get to the point where you know we're in a news post covid normal how is your thinking how has your thinking of in terms of you know what you want the business to be what you think the practice looks like uh i know you have a focus on digital you know that was there before uh can you just give us a sense for maybe what you might have learned in the last few months and how your thinking has evolved have done that future strategic vision thank you thanks steve um you know i i think what covid has done is brought into sharper focus what i think uh the industry's gonna need to be and you know whether it gets there in two years three years five years um i i think it's gonna accelerate a couple trends i mean the first is that you know i i think dsos are are going to pick up uh you know i don't think it's gonna happen in the in the immediate short term but i i think uh if if you look at in europe uh in us and even in places in asia pacific where the pandemic exposed you know sometimes uh some of the offices are are kind to write on the margin and the dentist may feel it's better to practice in a larger group so i think they're they're you may see a shift that way i think the second big thing is you know the the idea of when you say digital i i push digital pretty hard uh in in my mind what i think whether it's the dsos or the individual dentists are gonna be doing is they're really gonna be evaluating their practice more critically and i think covid uh brought that into sharp focus that hey look i've got forty hours to see patients how am i uh allocating time against procedures uh and and how am i thinking about you know what procedures can i do and what procedures do i really want to develop within the practice and i'm gonna i'm gonna address that wordingly from the equipment and where i emphasize um you know our training and whatnot so you know i i think what we've seen with clear aligners is something that's gonna go into the rest of dentistry uh you know when the think about implants uh when you think about even uh basic endo work i think the increased digitization of diagnostics and and how that can help uh dentist practice at the highest level of their licenses is is is it's going to accelerate so i would i would say steve i don't think anything's dramatically changed uh strategically what i think it it's you know and you read all the books and you know after major disruptions and dislocations you tend to see new trends go i i think what might have taken a decade because dental tends to be a little bit slower than what what we saw in med tech uh i think is gonna accelerate pretty dramatically i couldn't agree more thanks for all the uh the help here all right thanks steve stay safe thank you and our next question is from john craiger with william blair please go ahead all right thanks very much uh don tears could you give us an up date on the uh your integration efforts uh i'm sure covid has impacted them a little bit but you had a pretty long list across commercial manufacturing and r and d just kind of give us a sense about where that stands and to what degree the pandemic has kind of altered the the thinking around them um you know john uh first thanks for the question you know when i i would say when we outlined things in november of eighteen you know we kind of said it was a three year program uh i i would say that uh and particularly with the announcements we made this morning around traditional ortho and analog lab uh it it kind of points to the fact that we're pushing a little bit faster and we're pushing harder i think the uh pen them is accelerated our thinking and um you know look when you when you see the revenue challenges in the second quarter it also highlights you know some of the things that we need to get after even faster so that's kind of what would tell you um i i it is really interesting internally uh we keep trying to tell people hey look it's not as if we're gonna get the restructuring done and then that's it you know we're not changing ever again so i've been trying to get is in the organization to understand that this is a marathon and and uh you know the restructuring might have have been only the first ten k of that uh so look i i i would tell you in terms of the plan we laid out we're we're more than halfway done um but i would also tell you you know it's great as i brought in a new team with people like <unk> we've got a terrific supply chain leader we've actually now got all the commercial people reporting into one people one person walter peterson uh we're finding more and more stuff that we think that we can uh improve on that should have y you know really deliver the promise of what that supplies aroma should be so you look specifically hey you know if you thought it was a three-year restructuring you know we're we're slightly ahead of where we thought we would be i would just tell you that we're our management team is committed to as soon as we get done that restructuring we're we're not stopping we're how do we continuously improve uh that's great thanks and then one last one how is your implant for folio performing how did it do in the second quarter and uh are are you rethinking that line up at all uh implants is you know we've been happy with our implant business um i i would tell you you know when you say the set and quarter john it it's it's an interesting challenge in terms of what language do you use you know implants did well relative but you know versus prior year uh you know across the whole portfolio was challenging um as we talk and think brief think about our portfolio you know look we we think we we've started to actually get our new products where we need to get them um you know obviously we've talked about our immediate load astrav product and and i think that's the first of what you'll see a a pretty uh regular set of introductions over the next eighteen months in our in our implant space that are gonna really let us be competitive the other thing that we've been doing uh with implants that you know doesn't get a lot of highlight you know we have a a a business m i s that we had bought a couple of years back which lets us play a little bit more aggressively in the value segment and uh as as we've been rethinking how we approach our commercial go to market strategy across all of dense pressure and including on implants being able to integrate that and expand that beyond the base of of what they used to operate in when we bought them has been beneficial there so you know we feel that implants remains a significant growth opportunity for us i would say say that um you know we're starting to get the portfolio where we need to get it uh i'm extremely uh excited about what i think the new products uh in that space are gonna be able to deliver for us you know over the next you know a couple years sounds good thank you thank you our next question is from john block with stephen please go ahead this is trevor on for john thanks for take my questions um so i think you mentioned earlier that your patient tracking is saying that patient confidence has been continuing to go up recently i'm wondering if there's any detail you can give there on just like how that's shaken out geographically and and if there's a read through to you know potentially some of your july comments um you know through that confidence level yeah sure thanks trevor um a couple things i i mean first we're we're doing patient tracking across the entire globe uh and and again we we've seen consistent improvement around you know people likely to visit the dentist and and we measure it likely to visit in the you know the next thirty days the next quarter and whatnot so we've been seeing consistent improvement across the board there interestingly there's a kind of a subgroup people have been to the dentist have had really positive experiences around how people you know whether it's you know adjusting waiting room or you know how they're addressing infection protocols so we see that group is pretty positive on one of the things we were trying to watch as they were kind of the flare-ups in the us in in particular geographies whether there was going to be a drop-off in in patient confidence and we didn't see that so you know look i and and by the way well most of the patient data is good there is um reluctance on you know kind of a a segment of the population to say you know am i gonna go back in the next month versus do i intend to go back to the dentist in the next six months so you know there's a little bit of a lag there um that that we see uh particularly in the us but we don't see it uh else elsewhere around the world so patient patient tracking has been actually a good lead indicator and and again we're we're seeing um we're seeing some good things there yeah thank you and then just one more on dsos you know we've been hearing that dsos and larger practice groups are tending to perform better in this environment i'm just wondering if that's what you've been seeing and if you think that um you know some of the smaller uh more fragmented practitioners could start to play catch up as well um we to to be honest we haven't seen a a a a huge differentiation between the uh the dsos and and the end of it know practices you know the thing that that we love about this market is that you know that whether the you know there's six hundred thousand dentists around the world um and they're independent business owners and they're a lot of them are very are inventive and creative about how they you know go after and and make sure that they're reaching out to their patients and whatnot so i i look do i think on the margin if if somebody was considering retiring in a year or two and and covid hit you know do they sit there and say now maybe the time that i sell right that yeah you might see a little bit of that but you know we haven't seen a uh a sharp change in the number of dental practices that we're doing business with and and you know we think that we haven't seen a drop off in the aggregate number of dental practices in key regions post covid so when we when we're watching you know when we say things are eighty percent open ninety percent open ninety nine we haven't seen the um the number of practices that we're measuring that against change great thank you so much thanks trevor thank you and what and with that we conclude our q and a session for today i would like to turn the call back to john sweeney for his final remarks thank you very much everybody we look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of the year have a good day thank you and gentleman for participating in today's program and you may now disconnect and have a great day
