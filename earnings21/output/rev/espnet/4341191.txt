good morning and welcome to the first quarter twenty twenty general electric company earnings conference call my name's brandon and i'll be your operator for today at this time all participants are in listen only mode later we will get the question and answer session during what you can tell star one if you have a question please note this conference is being recorded and i will not turn it over to steve when occur vice president of investor communications you may begin thanks brandon good morning and welcome to ge's first quarter twenty twenty earnings call i'm joined by our chairman and ceo larry <unk> and cfo carolina <unk> before we start i'd like to remind you that the press release and presenting are available on our website note that some of the statements we're making are forward looking and are based on our best view of the world and our businesses as we see them today as described in our scc filings and on our website those elements can change as the world changes with that i'll hand the call over to larry steve thanks good morning everyone we hope you and your families are healthy and safe our thoughts are with all of those affected by this global pandemic we read recognize this is a very difficult and challenging time for everyone on behalf of ge i want to express our gratitude to those on the front lines in the medical community many of whom were privileged to call our customers working tirelessly to protect all of us thank you when we last spoke during our outlook call in march we were encouraged by the continued strength in aviation and healthcare and the progress made in power and renewables in the week since the world has fundamentally changed as we all know the covid nineteen pandemic evolved rapidly hitting hard and hitting fast while this is an earnings call our goal today is to provide you with the current and relevant information we have and as always to be as open and transparent as we possibly can so forgive us if we run a little long today the covid nineteen dynamics at ge like the economy at larger food and still evolving but clearly challenging in the near term with that i'll start with our response to covid nineteen carolina who is joining our earnings call for the first time we'll cover the financials then i'll wrap with a more in-depth view to of our current operations moving to slide two during this unprecedented time we're focused on three areas first the health and safety of our employees and our communities we established a covid nineteen task force that is working to ensure we're doing everything in our ability to protect the health and safety and aligning with various government directives and medical advisors in real time to that end we've encouraged those employees who were not directly performing customer facing essential jobs to work from home wherever possible but given the mission critical work we do at ge not everyone can stay home i'd like to acknowledge our employees out in the field and in our factories for their unwavering dedication to if they continue to deliver for our customers supporting essential services like hospitals power generation airlines and national defense we're ensuring they have what they need to do their job safely to simply temperature screenings face coverings and gloves is necessary and physical distancing all keeping with national state and local guidelines i'm also inspired by the support that our employees have shown each other we re certainly established an employee relief fund and more than seventy five senior leaders across ge have contributed portions of their salary to support those affected by this crisis our second priority is continuing to serve our customers in healthcare we're ramping production of critical medical equipment used to diagnose and treat covid nineteen patients including respiratory ct monitoring solutions x-ray anesthesia and point of care ultrasound product lines our ready our team is double production of ventilators and plans to double again by the end of june healthcare's digital and ai solutions are helping hospitals remotely monitor multiple patients at once and automate road tasks clinicians can spend more of their precious time focused on life saving work across all of our businesses were in constant communication with employees customers suppliers and governments to maintain business continuity without disruption our third priority is preserving our strength first and foremost sound liquidity is crucial in solidifying our balance sheet remains a key focus with the recent closing of the biopharma transaction we received twenty billion of net proceeds this provides ge with optionality to protect our company and remain flexible and importantly we retained a seventeen billion leading healthcare business at the center of an ecosystem driving a for precision health preserving our strength in a timeline this also requires a different operating model here i draw my experience as a ceo managing through nine eleven and the global financial crisis there are three steps in this model embrace reality redefine winning and execute the plan easy to say hard to do starting with embrace reality this is necessary in a time like this when someone has changed and remains uncertain for us it means recognizing that we're facing significant headwinds in aviation and we may be for a while we wish it were otherwise but that's not our reality next three to five and winning we came into twenty twenty with a plan that defined winning is profitable growth margin expansion and cash generation now we need to adjust to the altered environment to focus and inspire our team let me share some ways we're doing this while safety has always been a top priority for ge covid nineteen has reshaped our safety agenda in terms of our financial priorities improving our cash generation and detrimental margins in the second half our key focus areas and in healthcare the clearly didn't come into the year expecting to increase our ventilator production or fold but we will and finally execute the plan we're moving to speed discipline and intensity to improve our cost structure already more than two billion of cost actions and more than three billion of cash actions and this is where lean is particularly relevant from daily management to traditional combined systems which help reset inventory levels to do problem solving tools we're rolling out across g e let me share a recent example from gas power in our greenville facility the team used lean to cut the distance that a single part travels during production from three miles yes three miles to a mirror one hundred sixty five feet flashing the time it took to make that part by forty two percent these are the sort of operational efficiencies that are more essential than ever in this environment so that's our approach here we're facing the pandemic head on while in ten need to execute our long term strategy for ge moving to slide three you'll find a snapshot of our first quarter results and carolina will take you through this in detail but first a few top line thoughts as i noted we entered the year with momentum however as covid nineteen continued to spread globally and i'm not gonna sugar coat this we got hit hard and some of our highest margin parts of our best performing businesses this is especially true at aviation services where covid nineteen cost a rapid decline in commercial aviation demand and even essential travel became difficult in the second half of march a similar situation also transpired at power services where travel restrictions cost by covid nineteen impacted our field personnel and across all of our businesses we started to see some project fulfillment and execution issues at the same time healthcare performed well due to urgent demand for our products used in the fight against of nineteen taking a step back about eighty percent of our roughly four hundred billion dollar backlog is in services which have a long time horizon and while services have been hurt in the near term those capabilities remain one of our great of strengths they keep us close to our customers with deep strategic relationships especially through periods of volatility so in the spirit of embracing reality let me frame for you what we're seeing right now at a high level and then i'll do a deeper dive after carolina reviews the first quarter in aviation in a g cast airlines are conserving cash not flying the planes they have limiting maintenance spare spend where they can and all the while deferring orders in many places no one can predict win and how leisure and business travel will resume but the reality is likely it's not soon so we're redefining winning from margin expansion in twenty twenty to improving our detrimental margins this year which we requires we aggressively adjust our cost structure that's what winning looks like for aviation and they're moving forward with a comprehensive plan to be clear we'll get back to targeting those twenty percent operating margins post-pandemic in healthcare and we been on the front lines combating covid nineteen since the early days in wuhan this is fundamental to our mission while we've seen demand surge for certain products other products including those in our high margin pharmaceutical di ostics business have been negatively impacted as multiple procedures are deferred healthcare is likely to rebound faster than aviation but we're still fast tracking additional cost out actions targeting an incremental seven hundred million dollars since karen and the team spoke with you in december and power and renewable energy the impact of covid nineteen has been more limited to date specifically at power we're experiencing outage delays and restrict and field service travel and we're monitoring new unit orders and services to offset this we're further right sizing the cost structure and in power we already reduced head count by seven hundred in the first quarter now clearly across ge there are a number of large variables that are unknown at this point including the full duration magnitude and pace of recovery across our end markets operations and supply chains we're also monitoring of the resulting interest rate environment will impact pension obligations and our runoff insurance business so let me tell you what we do know the second quarter will be the first full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen and we expect that our answer results will decline sequentially before they improve later this year the bottom line is we have some challenging times ahead but this too shall pass i'm confident the underlying reset we took over the last eighteen on to focus to east portfolio and it's still a greater focus on customers and lean give us a running start for what we face today moreover i see in our response to covid nineteen signs of how we're moving faster to change ge for the good more lean work to help reduce inventories in the face of demand challenges in aviation travel restrictions spring on the use of remote digital technology to complete build work and renewables and more capital discipline across the board with new leaders assimilating faster and with real impact healthcare comes to mind so all of this in combination with the planned actions will discuss later are accelerating our transformation of ge with that i'll turn it over to carolina but before i do let me say how please i am to have her on board in two short months it's clear we share the same perspectives of embracing reality and operational bias for action and executing with speed thank you larry i'm proud to join my first earnings call <unk> of you is and help with this company until forward as you noted we're operating in unprecedented times i have been focused on first keeping our financial position strong and safe with a keen eye on leverage and liquidity as well as cash flow and capital discipline but this actions over the last couple of years have put us on stronger footing it has of this situation we will do more second working with our businesses to take the right action not only to help mitigate the impact of covid nineteen but to serve customers better operate smarter and more efficiently and integrate more holistically by larry and i are focused on the near term we're also managing for the long term we're working together to reduce complexity actually is being a loan culture that delivers sustainable earning and cashflow generation today my intention is to take you through our results in detail and provide context that help you see what i see across the businesses with that let's come to slide four this was a challenging quarter for us as the micro and rapidly deteriorated taking it from the top first quarter orders were down three percent organically or down four x by pharma growth in power and healthcare was affected by double digit decline in aviation and renewables both equipment and service orders were down low single digit i'll cover this by business shortly industrial revenue was down five percent organically were down six x biopharma with equipment revenue flat and services down nine percent both aviation and power services were adversely impacted in the quarter due to covid nineteen adjusted industrial profit margins were down four hundred and fifty basis points organically most of the solution came from aviation and renewables the aviation impact mostly driven by covid nineteen now let's discuss the eps what starting at continuing eps of seventy two cents there was a seventy five cents gain primarily related to the eleven point times the <unk> from the biopharmacy which also included one sense of tax benefit in <unk> this was partially accepted by a four point six billion of the tax loss on our remaining make a huge stake which we measure at served <unk> on restructuring and other items we incur two sense of charges this is principally related to the reduction of aviation's us workforce softly non-operating pension and other benefit plants were six cents had been in the quarter excluding this items adjusted bps was five cents as described earlier our earnings performance was materially impacted by covid nineteen and other market dynamics this was primarily innovation and ge capital negative marks and impairments in both tweakers and insurance as well as higher credit costs we estimate the first quarter industrial operating profit impact from covid nineteen roughly seven hundred million drivers included were off the market sales project list and supply chain constraints this input is higher than anticipated at the march outlet com reflecting the rapid global progression of the pandemic but our prior focus largely affected slowed down in china our focus on addressing this pandemic is global we're targeting more than two billion of cost out this year but this may not affect the full impact we're rapidly addressing both cost and cash and making our business in more agile and customer focus over time i can tell you from my experience that this program feels momentum and the company leaders begin to see how powerful results can be they can't extend beyond their stated goals so just that i have seen so i'm encouraged that we can have some of that same experience at you moving to cash as many of you know the first quarter is typically low for our free cash flow this year we're impacted by our usual personality but also covid nineteen especially in aviation industrial free cash flow was a use of two point two billion one billion worse than prior year that's notably excluding aviation each industrial business improved free cash flow versus last year turning to the key drivers in the quarter starting with net earnings if you exclude the biopharma gain and the market market on our make huge investment income depreciation and motivation total seven hundred million that's down nine hundred million versus prior year next working capital negative two point six billion so the significant use of cash down one point one billion let me take it through the main factors first we had a net inflow in accounts receivable driven by seasonally lower volume in gas power and renewables second we had an outflow in account table driven by lower volume in aviation and higher dispersments related to priority and material by in renewables third increase inventory to support an expected second and third quarter volume ramp in onshore wind and shop output decline innovation fourth progress collection they were a use of cash as new orders and milestones payments we're more than affected by burn down of prior progress payments in power and renewables lastly we also spent about six hundred million in gross capex we don't track now to reduce twenty five percent of our capex spent this year for cash flow in total we estimate the first quarter impact from covid nineteen was around one billion the majority of which was health innovation as we look forward we expect continued free cash flow pressure between everything more than three billion in cash action however over time we know that each business can be a better cash generate as we improve execution moving to slide six we continue to strengthen our balance sheet the largest milestone in the quarter was closing by a pharma the twenty billion of this we ended the quarter with thirty three point eight billion of industrial cash approximately sixteen billion sequentially here capital and with thirty point five billion of cash down approximately five point three billion sequentially driven by contractual maturities we continue to hold a liquidity balance covering twelve months of the death maturities we recently take action to enhance and expand our liquidity and pay down that on april seventeen ge entered into a three year fifteen billion indicated revolving credit facility this was a planned refinancing of this prior twenty billion indicated revolver current facility including bilateral agreements we expect to have in the range of twenty billion in total credit line access going forward following the sale of biopharma we also improved our liquidity profile in april we reduced our near term debt maturities by issuing six billion in <unk> in april and subsequently can ring for four point two billion of debts we plan to use the remaining one point eight billion opposites to further debt reduction and the combination of transaction will therefore be leveraged new one following this d industrial has no that maturity in twenty twenty one one point nine billion of maturities in twenty twenty two and nine hundred million in twenty twenty three actually industrial reduced approximately seven billion we reduced commercial paper used by one point one billion in the quarter and we paid six billion of the intercompany loans from u e t g e capital in april using proceeds from biopharma to the cap we reduced that by four billion so we reduced external left by ten billion yesterday including four point seven billion of maturities in the quarter and an additional five point four billion of twenty twenty maturities tended in april upset by g is six billion retirement for the in the company alone our financial policy goes remain maintaining a high cash balance achieving less than two point five times method to ebay achieving the and less than four times steps to equity at the capital accredit writing in the single arrange and reinstating a dividend in line with peers over time we remain committed to achieving our leverage targets but we now expect to achieve those targets over a longer period than previously not due to the impact of covid nineteen next on site seven will discuss industrial segments results starting with aviation the as you've noted our first quarter results were materially impacted orders were down thirteen percent organically with both equipment and service orders down equipment orders were down twenty seven percent primarily driven by commercial engines business due to the max grounding and the covid impact services orders were down four percent primarily driven by commercial services partially affect by military uh which one you fighter and helicopter service orders from the us to unit service orders were stronger than revenues due to the military orders which were up sixty percent year over year backlog of two hundred and seventy three billion was flat sequentially and up twenty two percent versus prior year primarily driven by long term service this included roughly two hundred leads one billion unit order cancellations in the quarter revenue was found eleven percent organically equipment revenue was found seventeen percent we shipped four hundred and seventy two commercial installed and spare engine units this quarter down thirty seven versus prior year safe of two hundred and seventy two d one a and one day units were down a hundred and fifty two and see if i'm fifty six units were down ninety eight units service revenue was down eight percent due to commercial services down eleven percent this was driven by lower spare part shipments and lower ship visits from the impact of covid nineteen thirty military revenue was down seven percent with a hundred forty six engine unit shipments down nine percent and this was driven by supply chain fulfillment dynamics and inbound materials partly upset by the advanced programs growth operating profit was down thirty nine percent organically primarily on lower volume and negatively pressure in commercial services from the impact of covid nineteen and lower spare engineers segment margin contracted six hundred fifty basis points organically this was primarily due to covid nineteen impacting our commercial businesses in both engines and services they continued seven thirty seven max grounding the non-replace of prior year favorable contract adjustments and the first full quarter of revenue from our aerodrivatives business now that we have deconsolidated big issues add a bit more color covid nineteen represents just over half of the year of the year margin difference seven thirty seven max timing considering into and sparring and volume and supply chain access costs represent additional twenty percent of the volume moving to healthcare which performed well orders were up nine percent organically equipment orders were up forty the fact and services were up one healthcare orders excluding by pharma were up six percent driven by a surge demand related to covid nineteen this was partially accepted by delays in procurement and lower demand of products less related to covid nineteen examples like mr and interventional in health care systems as well as contrasts with uh a new care tracers in uh pharmaceutical diagnostics my sciences orders were at ten percent backlog was seventeen point four billion down six per sense sequentially and down three versus uh prior to the sale of biopharma so excluding biopharma backlog was up one percent sequentially and four versus prior year revenue was up two percent organically and one percent excluding biopharma healthcare systems revenue was up two percent for services and three percent with equipment flat life scientists was up four percent operating profit was up ten percent organically segments margin expanded a hundred and forty days points organically or thirty basis points excluding biopharma this was driven by volume and cost productivity offset by price and logistics pressures from covid nineteen next on power we had mixed results with equipment top line strengths of fit by challenges in services orders were up fourteen percent organically just how orders were up eight percent with equipment orders up thirty seven percent larger due to one twenty orders you book two point two you go up orders for nine guest services guest power service orders were down three percent with contractual services down and transactional upgrades roughly flat power portfolio orders of twenty seven percent with strong equipment as a this orders in still and power conversion that you've closed at eighty five billion that's questioning and down one percent versus prior year <unk> was seventy one billion of that sequentially revenue was down twelve percent organically largely driven by services in gas power revenue was down twelve percent gas power equipment revenue was at four percent organically on higher hitch turbine mix we shipped nine gas turbine versus sorry we should seven guest turbines versus nine guest turbines in the first quarter of nineteen we helped our customers achieve commercial operations on over thirty two units translating almost four point seven give us a new power added to the grid that's power services for revenue was down nineteen percent strategy i filed this transaction state pushed out of the quarter due to covid nineteen and we had lower revenue on higher margin upgrades despite this services would still have been down in the quarter the was driven by supply based constraints on hot gas parts and outreach costs overall pressuring our csa margin rate power portfolio revenue was down twelve percent this was driven by lower volumes across the sub segments in still we had lower services backflow convertibility in nuclear the decline was driven by outage timing and empower conversion we find our sales perimeter focused on higher margin market segment operating profit was down two hundred and thirty nine million and segment margin contracted five hundred and seventy basis points organically by against power fixed costs were down nine percent sequentially and sixteen versus prior year this was more than offset by lower service volume and additional cost from covid nineteen disruption next or renewables continue revenue growth was more than offset by fulfillment and execution issues impacting profitability orders were down eleven percent organically equipment were down eleven as recycling a stronger us ptc and services were down twenty three percent the positive spot in the quarter was international orders which were up eleven percent backlog of twenty six point five billion on four percent sequentially but up five percent versus prior year revenue was up twenty eight percent organically this was mainly driven by onshoring up sixty percent onshore equipment revenue was up eighty one percent with the new unit turbine deliveries of seven hundred and thirty one more than double prior year and with power gate deliveries of two hundred and nineteen up forty percent unsure services revenue excluding the power kids so that fifty percent the onshore order pricing index continues to stabilize at one percent in line with listing trump green revenue was down eight percent mostly due to site closures and delayed milestones driven by covid nineteen operating loss were down a hundred and fifteen million this was driven by the supply chain disruptions due to covid nineteen for payment list and the non-recurrence of a non-cash gain from an offshoring contract termination in the prior year this was partially upset by higher onshore wing volume segment margin contracted to one hundred and ten basis points mainly driven by the same items mentioned about and the range of execution issues we're fixing at grid and hydro moving to slide eight starting with the capital in the quarter adjusted continued operations generated a net loss of a hundred and eighteen million this excludes the impact of the capital loss tax benefit utilized against by a form again resulted in eighty eight million of earnings compared to prior year which excludes excludes the us tax reform benefit continuing net earnings was unfavorable by a hundred and fifty four million this was due to negative marks and impairments at gcf and insurance lower again and lower earnings from smaller assets this was partially affected by lower excess interest costs and sgna the under the quarter with a hundred and one billion of assets excluding liquidity this was done one billion sequentially primarily driven by gcs due to assets to appreciation and collection portion of set by new volume insurance assets were flat sequentially as a decrease in unrealized gains driven primarily by higher market rates was offset by the annual insurance capital contribution supply chain finance assets were down as our suppliers continue to migrate to m u f t as noted earlier capital ended the quarter with thirty point five billion of liquidity capital also ended with fifty four point five billion of that which was down four point five billion sequentially driven by death maturity this continued operations generated a net loss of a hundred and sixty four million which was unfavorable versus prior year by two hundred million if they plan to provide the required support to do a capital in line with insurance statutory funding next just like our businesses corporate let's suggest our new realities and we are continuing to take additional structural actions to rationalize cost and reduce the size of corporate looking at the quarter adjusted corporate costs were three hundred and seventy four million eight percent higher but that's primarily due to hire in the company profit eliminations which will partially assess by better digital performance from continuing cost reduction action functions and operations with twenty five percent lower primarily driven by ge digital improve you can see from digital performance that the focus cost reduction programs are getting correction we continue to right size our functional costs across you and push more accountability into the division larry and i conducting cost and cash reviews of each of the businesses with fresh eye in the current environment so you can expect that there will be more to come stay tuned i have spent most of my career in leadership at learn this centralized fundamentally i believe companies outperform when they have a structure that empowers businesses to take the right actions quickly this type of structure is critical to respond to situations like we have today with covid nineteen but also to be prepared to be able to grow we're working toward this goal and there will be more to come did that affect your larry currently thank you there's no question that covid nineteen is putting real pressure on our businesses given that so much has changed and this quarter will be our first full quarter with pressure from covid nineteen i'd like to spend some time here discussing second we're trending based on what we're seeing through the month of april so starting with aviation on slide nine of all of our industrial segments this business is feeling the impact of the pandemic most severely the rat contraction fair travel is resulted in a significant reduction in demand as commercial airlines suspend routes and crown large percentages of their fleets we'll cover commercial services and engines on the next two slides in detail but on the other end of the spectrum demand for our military business remains strong to that end we re rebalanced some of our capacity to meet this increased demand to offset some pressure in the commercial business we're taking several steps that while painful preserve our ability to adapt as the environment continues to evolve we've previously announced five hundred to one billion in costs and cash actions and we've now increased this targeting more than one billion in cost actions and more than two million in cash actions this will be achieved through different initiatives some of which have been completed others in flight as we speak these include a ten percent reduction in aviations total us workforce and furloughs impacting fifty percent of its us maintenance repair and overhaul facilities and new engine manufacturing will continue to monitor and potentially extend as required we're also focused on reducing the discretionary and capex spend and optimizing working capital i know aviation's detrimental margin through this pandemic is top of mind for investors and carolina touched on the main dynamics impacting our margins in the quarter while we that our commercial revenues and profits will continue to be down in the second quarter our expectations are that the cost actions we're undertaking will improve detrimental margins in the back half of the year while there are many uncertainties i expect that we will exit the year with a much lower detrimental margin than what you saw in the first quarter so make no mistake driving improvement here is our number one focus as we think about the full year we're tracking travel restrictions carrier and passenger behavior disease counter measures and freight demand all of which will impact aircraft departures and revenue passenger kilometers while we're seeing an unprecedented decline in twenty twenty we're taking action and david and the team are working proactively with our cut to navigate through this crisis so spending a little more time on commercial services which represented three point three billion of revenue in the first quarter let's go to slide ten as you can see on the left side departures across the full industry were strong in the first quarter before rapidly declining in mid-march as we look at it this week focused on the ge and cfm fleet global departures are down approximately seventy five percent roughly sixty percent of the cfm fleet is parked today in line with this we're also seeing significant headwinds in global shop visits which were down low double digits in the first quarter and their lines to first short term maintenance and we expect this trend gets worse before it gets better with some potential to moderate in the latter half of the year depending on the variables just outlined based on what we're seeing through the month of april in the second quarter we're seeing shop visits down roughly sixty percent and csa billings down rough fifty percent additionally we expect the significant reduction and utilization is likely to continue to pressure our csa margins that said when the aviation industry recovers and it will recover over time ge is well positioned with the largest and youngest install base of all engine manufacturers additionally roughly sixty two percent of our gecf fleet has she has seen one shot visit or the last and this will general eight demand upon recovery we have more narrow bodies that are ten years or younger than than the narrow body install base of the rest of the industry and when we see a pickup and air travel demand we expect narrow bodies will recover a most quickly overall it was a challenging quarter and we're expecting additional pressure here in the second but our past actions will alleviate some of the pressure in the second half of twenty twenty willing to commercial engines which represented one point five billion of revenue in the first quarter in life of covid nineteen airframers are producing at a lower rate based on what we're seeing through the month of april in the second quarter we see installed engines down roughly forty five and spare engines down roughly sixty percent year on year attributable to the delivery deferrals in addition to the already planned lower production rate on the seven thirty seven maps in the near term or right sizing production capacity and actively managing the supply base we have very strong relationships with the airframers and an attractive value proposition is evidenced by a multi-year backlog as you'll see on the right we have strong positions sole source on two of the biggest new engine and entrance and a sixty five percent win rate on the other while we acknowledge there's pressure on near term demand for new aircraft be stats demonstrate the customers see the value of ge technology we're taking the right act seems to be well positioned for the post-pandemic world moving healthcare which consists of healthcare systems and pdx in the second quarter to date we're seeing increased demand for vital medical equipment and to diagnose and treatment of covid nineteen within healthcare systems now these product orders including ventilators have increased one and a half to two times versus pre pandemic levels but at the same time we're seeing reduced demand for other diagnostic as certain procedures are deferred or canceled around the world to be clear these other diagnostics are still essential and often associated with saving lives in areas including oncology and cardiology but are currently deprived pdx is a similar story this is a high margin this is made of contrast agents and nuclear tracers associated with procedures that are being deferred or canceled right now several hcs product lines and most of pdx is down as much as fifty percent versus pre pandemic levels while these dynamics vary by country there appears to be a pattern emerging as geographies experience different stages of the virus taking china for example as hospitals come back online we're seeing a ramp and previously deferred procedures and increased demand for our equipment and consumables healthcare is accelerating its plan transformation to expand margins post biopharma by reducing head count fixed cost discretionary spend and marketing spend prioritizing r and d deferring capex and optimizing working capital looking forward we're most focused on the following indicators for healthcare hospital admission and occupancy rates and increase in non covid nineteen procedures changes in hospital cap x budgets government spending on healthcare broadly and development of covid nineteen tests treatments and vaccines based on our experience and and the market in april we expect to be down in the second quarter with potential recovery afterwards covid nineteen is highlighted the need to build and truly invest and and scale a new digitized infrastructure and quickly we're committed to our investments in our digital edison platform and solutions like neural virtual care solution which allows one clinician to remotely view numerous ventilated patients simultaneously helping to expand their com city while reducing their risk of exposure as our digital healthcare journey continues with the center of an ecosystem striving for precision health i'm very proud of the work our team is doing to combat covid nineteen moving to power on slide on slide thirteen we'll talk to the current trending in the second quarter to date and dynamics at gas power and power portfolio starting with gas power equipment while we're monitoring managing supply chain disruptions as of today we still see a path to forty five to fifty gas turbine deliveries this year but our orders profile when therefore cash down payments were several hundred million dollars while clear weaker due to ipp pressures in the us and mexico is we expect that deal financing will become harder through the year additionally with oil price pressure impacting middle east and ssa investment including demand for new l and g we are expecting a longer road to normalization ultimately we're sticking to our strategy of securing a lower risk margin of creative backlog with disciplined execution in services approximately twenty percent of planned outages are shifting from the first half of this year due to covid nineteen field labor constraints we're also seeing pressure on upgrades primarily in the middle east where low oil prices are impacting customer budget we are seeing ge gas turbine utilization in the us up mid single digits due to low gas prices and the ship from coal but utilization globally is down low double digits due to lower electricity demand within power portfolio our steam business is most impacted factory closures pressured our steam operations including one facility in move on which was closed for approximately eight weeks in the first quarter today we're back up to more than seventy percent of capacity the global supply chain has also been disrupted by the shutdown in india driven by government restrictions overall we're seeing about thirty percent of outages shift from the first half of this year to the second half with another or ten to fifteen percent pushing into next year our power businesses are taking several measures to offset these pressures in the first quarter we reduced head count by seven hundred notified approximately thirteen hundred contractors implemented a hiring freeze and in line with the demand profile we are taking even further actions this will serve to reduce fixed cost in twenty twenty and drive benefits in twenty twenty one looking for we're tracking a number of items including timing of our gas turbine new order closure service outages in volume weight utilization is the energy mix and fuel prices are impacting each region differently supplier impacts and project execution billing milestones and customer collections we're targeting to have our accelerated cost out measures drive organic margin expansion despite these demand changes moving to slide fourteen on renewables there was a limited impact of covid nineteen in the first quarter and our disappointing results continue to be largely about improving execution as we've said we think about renewables and three distinct operating pools starting with onshore wind while we continue to deliver at record levels in the americas we are seeing supplies change disruption at our lm win facilities and we're monitoring key commercial milestones such as permitting and financing which could potentially cause timing delays the in offshore wind certification for our industry leading turbine the holly x remains on track we're also on plan to start delivering on our eighty unit six megawatt commitments to edf after completion to this project in twenty twenty one we expect to start shifting production to the holly x we're also monitoring financial closure of twenty twenty deals grid and hydro are two turnarounds are impacted by supply chain disruption with over half of our growth facilities now operating below capacity and a grid automation we're also impacted by lower book to bill order conversion across all three of these pools we're increasing cost out in restructuring the and we've identified several hundred million dollars of additional actions longer term a lower cost structure will benefit renewables relating to the global supply chain we're focused on the safety opening of our plants globally and then optum using the workforce and plant load levels looking forward we were expecting a larger impact from covid nineteen in the second quarter and by business we're tracking twenty and twenty one demand impact on progress collections and potential cycles in onshore wind the risk of financing delays associated with deals at offshore project site delays at grid and hydro and the backlog at grid on slide fifteen within ge capital rg caps and insurance instances are where we are feeling the largest impacts so i'll keep my comments focused there first gcast is better positioned today than in previous downturns with better asset quality less customer concentration and more geographic diverse see that said we're preparing for elevated repossessions and redeployments as well as lease restructurings and we've had approximately eighty percent of our customers seek short term deferrals as you may have seen we've agreed with throwing on a rebalancing of our seven thirty seven match order both second and insurance marketing rate volatility is impacting the current value of our investment portfolio and reinvestment yields they're forward deploying capital which after market dislocation investment opportunities we're closely monitoring how this volatility will impact insurance this year and similar to the industrial segments are implementing incremental costs and cash actions looking forward we continue to expect higher impairments and lower asset sales at gcast and insurance our season teams are working closely with our customers to navigate through this period so to close our priorities are clear we rapidly localized our team in the face of covid nineteen with our top priority being the health and safety of our employees and overall the priorities we reviewed with you at the outlook call remain intact we're facing into our near term realities while continuing to manage ge for the long term when the world is facing the worst pandemic in a century our team is rising to the challenge with humility transparency and focus we continue to deliver value for our customers enabling air carriers to transport essential goods supplying vital healthcare equipment and keeping the lights on and while there are many unknowns there will be another side planes will fly again healthcare will normalize and modernize and the world still needs more efficient resilient energy at the same time we're embracing this new reality we're redefining winning the and we're executing our plan the cost and passion passions we've taken you through this morning are a major result these moves will ultimately allow us to accelerate our multi-year transformation to make ge of stronger nimbler and more valuable company and i am confident that ge will emerge stronger with that steve let's go to questions great before we open the line i'd ask everyone in the key you to consider your fellow analysts again and ask one question and a followup so we can get to as many people as possible brandon can you please open the line yes thank you sir we'll now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star one on your telephone keypad if you'd like to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key if you're on a speaker phone please pick up your handset first before dialing once again if you have a question please press star one on your telephone keypad and from vertical research we have jeff spring please go ahead thank you good morning everyone help everyone as well um thanks for all the uh the great details morning jeff good morning um i was hoping you could uh provide a little bit of color on how you uh you know kind of view the kind of the asset quality of the you know the contractual service agreements and the like there's a lot of assets there obviously there's at least a a temporary and of cash flows um how does that test work have you done it yet and are are you close to any particular thresholds there that we should be thinking about yes i i think if if we look at the uh the service backlog right broadly just under three hundred twenty five billion for the company uh the vast majority of that two hundred thirty four billion is in aviation i suspect that's that's where you're most focused we we go through those uh those backlog reviews and the csa uh reviews on a regular basis uh what we've done here over the last uh call it the last seven eight weeks is really tight and quick in the review process that we do with the uh the businesses both uh at aviation and gcas what we're trying to do is make sure we've got the latest and um if you will most uh most accurate information possible with respect to customer risk given uh given everything that's going on so we we we do that on a regular basis we did that at the at the end of the first quarter in uh in in closing much as we do every quarter clearly we've got a uh we've got a fluid uh situation and i think the uh the modest charges that we took uh the amount of changes in the first quarter clearly are gonna play out as we go through the course of the year we can't really scope that uh for you today if you look at the csa book in aviation for example uh as we went through the uh the mechanics of the future billings the future costs related to those billings uh based on the information at the time it was really just a hundred billion a hundred million uh adjustment non-can of course which is why you see a little bit of the earnings cash uh dynamic uh certainly as we go forward we're gonna be updating uh those uh those adjustments and again we would expect that we would see more of that uh given what the airlines are doing with uh with their planes but i think it's important to keep in mind again you know these these are ten to fifteen year agreements as you know and uh those adjustments are taken in the context of at uh uh particularly extended time period great thanks for that and just as a followup if i could um i know you don't want to get real precise on guidance but uh you know you you are uh pointing us to a further dick and cashflow and q2 which isn't surprising quite quite frankly but uh could you bracket that at all for us what we should expect for q2 and uh you know any high level thoughts on how the year plays out from the cash standpoint yeah jeff i i think that we uh we took guidance off the table a few weeks back and um didn't want to take an attempt at framing formal guidance here today in light of all of this flu and all that is still evolving here and i think that the tack we took was really to try to to to share as much with you as we possibly could in terms of the uh the april detailed business by business uh and acknowledge that we're gonna see a a more challenging second quarter here given the full impact of covid in the lake uh but beyond that i think that's that's really where we are we we we know we've got to get to work on the cost and the cash action that's why you see us doubling that activity aviation stepping it up um elsewhere around the company so uh the two billion of cost the three billion of cash uh will clearly help us later on in the year as those uh those actions uh take uh take root but for today i think that's really what we're uh that's what we know and that's what we're comfortable sharing great thanks best luck larry thanks all okay from morgan stanley we have josh poker's <unk> please go ahead josh your line is open yeah josh you might be off there why don't we what brandon let's let's move on and come back to josh okay sure next question we have from bank of america we have andrew open please go ahead uh yes good morning can you hear me andrew yep andrew okay well yeah just a question thank you so much and um uh we'd like to everybody um so run rate minus sixty percent in terms of shop visits uh fifty percent on csas do you think you continue to trend at this level in the second quarter or is there more that side andrew the uh i think you're referring to page nine and the slide deck yeah that's what we're seeing here yeah i i think this is what we're uh what we're seeing right now right and given uh given what the carriers have uh have said publicly what they're doing you know we think these are uh these are good likely uh near end run rates to share with you again we're not um trying to offer up a definitive view is to the next several quarters uh but this is you know this is what we're seeing right now in the second quarter for sure and uh my my follow question on uh spare engine sales i think uh minus sixty percent uh have we lost these or will these come back uh when the situation normalizes maybe you can give us some sort of framework how to think about spare engine demand over the next couple of years thank you so much andrew we were uh we we were ramping uh spares with with both the uh the leap one a and the leap one b as uh the neurobody market was taking off uh typical early in the life of an engine activity uh we are clearly seeing that uh soften uh not necessarily going to zero uh as preparations are being made for the return to service of the max right uh i don't think that that that opportunity has lost but i think like much of what we're seeing in aviation brought it will be uh it will be pushed out for a few years and again i don't think we're taking a definitive view as to what year what quarter things get back to if you will a normalized twenty nineteen level uh but we watch uh the uh the discussions out there about this being a multi-year uh recovery gradual slow i think we're uh embracing that reality and that applies uh really across the portfolio both okay on the oe side as well as the aftermarket spares included thank you very much for all the detail and stay safe thank you for your time thank you for being this research we have scott davis please go ahead hey good morning guys in welcome carolina thank you um guys larry any good morning larry any any way to think about the cost actions as it relates to kind of structural versus more kind of pandemic short term related sure well i i would i would say scott as you well know that when we're in a when we're in a mo like this you're uh you're you're moving as quickly as you possibly can um almost anywhere that you can so if you look at what we've announced to aviation the doubling of those activities today the broadening the across the company uh if you look at the the tally today there is a decidedly short term bias there that carolina and i are going to be working with the ceos over the coming weeks to uh transition to a more permanent uh action right if you look at what we did in aviation for example for example in terms of the temporary lack of works uh that was a way to quickly adjust our cost structure and that does on a variable basis to these uh shockingly fast changes in demand you might categorize that as temporary we need to work through uh the changes on a more permanent basis that require in light of the uh the length of the recovery that we're looking at so we have confidence in these in these numbers that we're sharing today the two billion of costs the three billion of cash uh there's a bit of a tactical by today just given how fresh this is but we will be leaning in toward making more of them permanent recognized and at the end of the day there will be a uh a bit of a mix uh be it be it head count related discretionary spend on the cost side in addition to some of the working capital and certainly the capex reduction the carolina reference the twenty five percent reduction uh year on year so a lot going on and uh by no means is this uh uh these headlines today the uh the end it's very much at work in broadcast okay that's helpful larry and when you think you know the twenty billion dollars kind of came to you pretty much about her the timing but you know does that money just sit on the balance does that have to sit on the balance sheet pretty much as is for the for the year can you or is it just such a big number you can start to part some of it out to you know thinking in terms of of whittling down some of the of you know debt that you can you can manage well we uh it it it did come at a uh at a at a good time uh there's there's no question that's why we put the emphasis in in the biopharma set up uh on on certainty right we wanted to take the market risk off the table relative to thinking through the uh the healthcare options carolina anything you want to add relative to kind of managing liquidity versus leverage right here i think this yeah i think it's important to acknowledge that the world is different now compared before covid and it's very important for us of course leverage is important but liquidity is very important uh and we end the quarter with forty seven billion cash right and that's really to cover early billion of d e g capital in terms of maturities now through twenty one and actually after the april actions we are down to thirteen billion of maturities for twenty twenty one all of that in in capital and i would also say you know we expect to have around twenty billion and in total credit lines going forward and that's really in line with our risk appetite we have the new uh fifteen billion three year rcfs that i mentioned and five billion of data will be on the twenty business credit lines and i think we just so that you know we really entitlement at a high level of cash i would say to maximize flexibility and that's why we're taking these actions also to the risk of balance and basically prudently manage our liquidity in these very challenging external environment and time that that makes sense and thank you and good luck to you guys thank you thanks scott be well and let's try josh <unk> from morgan family please go ahead sir hi guys can you hear me this time yes yes clearly josh good morning awesome um and and hope everyone is as well that got earlier comments larry can you just give us a sense and uh know you guys have data going back eons and in aviation how the impact of of retirements and candolizations you know kind of make more of a a a usa versus you know what you know the the air traffic may look like is is there a natural lag between when folks start flying again and when when shop visits can happen just as a function of kind of using up some of the run time on otherwise idle assets well josh i you know certainly we have uh we have revisited the history the team is uh is well-versed in in what we have seen in years past i'm not sure we've we've seen anything uh kind of on a part with uh with this uh but there's there's no question that there there's going to be a bias on the part of some as some of these fleet uh reductions play out to retire some of the older aircraft um and that will factor into the uh to the after market much like some of the dynamics around green time and how here in the short term uh folks try to preserve cash carriers to try to preserve cash you and uh in in their business so i'm not sure that there is necessarily uh an exact model that captures what all the carriers and aggregate are going to do here a model that offers great precision i think we do know that this that the combination of these factors is gonna create pressure for us um uh for us here in the short term uh i think what's most important for our business really is is cycles much more so than uh revenue passenger miles uh and as we see schedules come back as we work our way through the pandemic that will uh that will put us back on i think better footing but here in the short term i think we're acknowledging that we're gonna see shot visits and csa building uh take on some real pressure due to the downturn understood thanks i'll leave it there from jp morgan we have steve <unk> please josh uh hey guys good morning hey steve good morning um in in uh in early march you guys had that slide that showed um you know two to four billion in you know free cash flow guidance which is obviously off the table but you also talked about of things growing in you know twenty one and twenty two and you know off that kind of three billion dollar base i think you know most research and um numbers i saw were kind of in that you know um six billion dollar range of of free cash flows and on a growth off of that level are we still um like is are the out here numbers um still at all legit or is that you know are you kind of withdrawing that long term outlook as well steve i think we have immediately been focused on taking the right actions both the cost the cash the uh the balance sheet actions here in the short term in the face of this uh the unprecedented a pandemic um we've taken guidance off for the year we're not putting it back on today just given the uh given the undue uncertainty of it all right so i i don't uh i don't think we're trying to get out any further than than that um i appreciate the question but i think for purposes of today we're really just trying to uh frame for folks what we're seeing but that said however long it takes us to work through the i think we feel very good about our ability to come out stronger and get back on a uh on a positive cashflow growth trajectory got it carolina anything you would add to that well no i think it's important to to acknowledge that by taking out cost now and part of it being structural that gives us sort of as well as mitigating the detrimentals that helps improving things the mental the the the outer years i mean that would depend on the recovery on the industry as well so so that's that's i would say that's impossible to speak to today right right and and i guess how much on that structural cost side yeah yeah go ahead yeah no i'm just just one other point i think worth mentioning i mean i think what we're acknowledging here is that assistance played out in march and what we're seeing already in april right it really is hitting uh hitting us from a mixed perspective hard uh our highest margin businesses are really feeling in here i would think that on the uh on the recovery we would see um we would see it swing the other way when we get back uh and come off a bottom we should have positive mix effect uh it really across across the board particularly in aviation and healthcare um your your second question steve was relative to the car yeah that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that is that gonna cost you i mean like you know to come up with two to three billion dollars of cost and cash you know you've done you've cut your restructuring last you're pretty significantly needed a couple hundred million in the first quarter um i mean most companies kind of one for one what how much is this stuff gonna cost you this year on a cash basis yeah i i think what we have said um previously is we were gonna be down off of uh last year from a uh from an expense and from a cash perspective i think we're we're uh probably gonna end up more or less in line right keep in mind that some of the cost actions like furloughs don't carry restructuring charge with that right because they aren't permanent so part of what we're trying to do is squeeze out some of the temporary costs uh but all the while if we can uh we can make more structural moves we wanna make sure we've got room to do that but i'd say right now assume that it uh be relatively flat year on year but it's carolina indicated in her remarks um okay we want to try to do more if we can great all right thanks a lot best of luck guys thanks dave from ubs we have marcus submitter mayer please go ahead yeah good morning larry <unk> and steve um let me maybe follow up on the uh on the okay good morning um hey good morning um within the year so in your ten q you reference the asset numbers of forty eight percent rpk reductions if it's in an obviously five hours and rtks are two different stories but is that sort of a kind of scenario that you're playing through internally and and i'm just trying to get a sense what that would mean if you look at our sort of like nineteen aviation cash as a baseline sort of like where you know on on that type of scenario we could end up particularly you know looking at sort of what you've mentioned in your prepared remarks that you have i think sixty two percent of of a still ahead of shop with it one which arguably are the engines that are on the narrow bodies coming back first because they're probably the youngest um the youngest in the fleet right right just trying to get a sense for within the year how you're thinking about that well i i think that given what we what we highlighted relative to the the the april experience and the near term projection of that um there's no question that we're gonna continue to see the pressure on uh on cash at aviation that we've seen uh here of late right and that that will be our um undoubtedly our biggest headwind no sure sure but you know the you know shoppers that we heard sort of the numbers that you that you said but did you do sort of internal internal stress tests around um where you could end up is that is that just something that you said it's too early to comment no no no there's there's there's pl there's plenty of of planning for uh a again a uh an extended uh slow down here we're we're we're embracing this reality to the fullest extent possible we are not expecting this to bounce back uh in in the near term uh so we we we flag in the q the iota numbers we also reference others you see it in our own uh departure data here in april right we are we are we are way down that has a direct feed in the shop visits csa billings and the like so we're we're we're adapting to this new environment confident that it will recover so we're marcus we're we're simply not trying to uh uh assume that the the press sure base any time soon witness the uh the cost and the cash actions that we're taking sure okay no i appreciate that and maybe as a follow up quickly on on the capital side do you anticipate any change in the in the capital support there for for insurance in particular you you referenced that a little bit in the prepared remarks i think two billion is sort of the current number how are you thinking about that at the moment on the parent support uh to capital yeah and on the insurance yeah let's yeah let's take a step back then so uh in nineteen the capital had an inclusion from uh the four billion um the estimate for for this year is two billion uh on insurance funding um and those two billion um you know that significantly lower than the before um we estimated that the parent will need to support roughly in mind with this with some variables are still open and that depends on the capital itself right to take capital earnings the other two capital ending assets liquidity levels but basically it's about two billion as it looks now um and i would also say going forward which is the thing of follow up uh we do continue to to anticipate further funding um and that would be again through a combination of ge capitalist helps with their assets liquidity and future earnings um and on top of that possible captain contributions from team thank you from colin and company we have a quick time kinda please go ahead yeah thank you good morning guys good morning two questions two questions morning so at aviation it sounds like you guys acknowledge that on the way up um these bears business the after market the fifteen billion dollar commercial after market business will lag asm growth because of you know a younger fleet emerging you know uh a surge of youth service of will material and the like heartouts and obviously lower spares provisioning as the oe rates come down thirty to fifty percent i guess first question is when do you anticipate aviation free cash flow getting to break even is it even possible before calendar twenty two in that type of environment and then i have a follow up i'm not i'm not sure we would buy into the premise per se right i mean we we are a cycles business much more so um than than any other indicator and those cycles are gonna have to come back before the passengers do uh as you indicate the age of the fleet will will help us over time there could be some short term headwinds but we'll uh we'll we'll see how that plays out uh i think what we're acknowledging here is that we've been hit from a free cash perspective um in our uh you know our our our biggest and best cash generator at aviation uh but we're really not getting into uh much more much more in terms of the uh the pre-cash forecast on a on a multi-year basis it's just too soon there's just too many uh moving pieces for us to uh to be that forward leaning at this point we wish we could be it's just it's just not where we are okay and just to follow up you know obviously twenty twenty is a tough year we're gonna have some cash burn twenty twenty one unclear but certainly doesn't seem like an aviation we're gonna have a strong recovery um any so as we emerge from this we're gonna have you know more leverage and i guess the question is the guys have made some asset sales to leverage what else besides cost reduction can you do um to get the balance sheet better uh faster is there any other things that you guys are exploring or you might explore that's different than what you've done over the past year thank you well i would say that maybe i'm not sure i would say that there's a lot that is a please carolina well i was i was gonna say that to do things that we have well i i i love saying that yeah well i i would just i would just say it it at a high level we we are committed to our de-leveraging target of less than two and a half times on the industrial side and i think you've seen us make a lot of progress here to date which i hope underscores uh the seriousness of of that objective both on the ge side right like it's seven billion of debt reductions in the quarter and that capital i think it's up to ten um on a on a year to day basis given given some of the things we did in april clearly it's gonna take us a while longer here to hit those targets like i suspect most most companies but in terms of doing anything new or different i think we're gonna continue to try to run these businesses as as best we can be as disciplined as we can on the capital front uh the the the smart and thoughtful relative to some of the other obligations like uh like pension as you've seen us relative to uh the plan design and and some of the settlement options so i'm not sure they're necessarily new place per se uh but we'll continue to look at every and every option uh available to continue to strengthen the company strengthen the balance she'd bring those leverage levels down in the face of covid nineteen carolina i'm sorry i jumped in there anything to add there i would just add that the to the leverage comment also the liquidity that at times like this you know you do look at the liquidity and i i think it's important to say that um you really wanna maintain a high level of class to maximize the flexibility uh and you have seen the de-risking activities that we have um to sort of push out the death in the for the years so we keep optionality thank you yeah and i and i but i think to that i mean it's just important for us all to remember we we end of the quarter with forty seven billion of liquidity um on the back of the biopharma action and some of the other things that we have uh done so we'll we'll continue to be nimble and flexible uh mindful of of of our obligations in our reality okay from barclays we have julian mitchell please go ahead hi good morning um maybe uh just the question where julian good morning maybe just the first question around the um the working capital uh dynamics and the free cash flow at aviation um i guess you know there's a lot of industrial businesses where when you get this rapid sales down draft you get a working capital cash offset to an extent and then it reverses uh whenever the sales come back could you just update us on how you see the working capital cash impact at aviation sort of in the early stages and out in this downturn um what you would expect to happen to work in capital when things recover and if there's any major difference on the cash dynamics of the power by the hour type service relative to the ads <unk> spares activity and aviation you know what i mean i would say <unk> yeah with respect to working capital uh i think our our primary challenge is really inventory at aviation right we we came into this year no and we were gonna have to adjust to a different schedule um with the max chasing the uh the step up at uh at airbus with the three twenty neo uh while dealing with a good bit of of of past due on the virtual side both both oe and um after market while having pretty good military demand to uh to to contend with that all gets uh reset here and one of the real pressures that we saw from a from a cashflow perspective was an inventory at aviation in uh in the quarter so that's that's where we're gonna be most focused trying to make sure that we reduce the delinquencies adjust to the reduce production schedules the lower after market requirements while continuing to take care of a military business it you know that that's a that's a complex supply chain undertaking uh but the team as you can imagine is uh teamly focused on using some of the lean tools working with our supply base to make sure that we not only take the cost out of the business but bring those inventory levels down um in in light of current current demand okay but should we expect um so i guess i i understand i'm sorry you know the julian this yeah is there a second part of your question i i may have missed that like we're all good yeah it was fine yeah and i guess you know in aviation you have the the you have the drop in ebitda in a downturn and then the recovery and ebitda in the early part of the upturn i was just trying to understand on working capital is that cash impact the counter cyclical or is it procyclical so you're you're getting a working capital outflow through the downturn as well as the ebitda decline i understand the the the the high level dynamic there that you're alluding to i i think right now the uh the simple reality of aviation given the pressures and the cross currence is that it is a neg is and we need to work to improve it how much of a tailwind could it be um kind of at this point in the cycle um i think it's too early to tell we've we've we've gotta get on the improvement path first julian to be able to take that uh potential and and deliver it in the financials as a reality thank you and then my second question was just around the um the operational issues so i think it sounds like the cost that tailwind should build through the year um but in q1 you had some operational issues in in power on the on the service side you know steep decrementals even with the fixed cost down sixteen percent renewables the margins were down despite a big revenue increase so i guess what's the conviction that operational inefficiencies will not swallow up a lot of these cost savings over the balance of the year well i think you have to take a business by business right um if if you look at what happened in power uh clearly the the push out by customers because of their own site uh restrict and by us on the back of the travel restrictions really pushed a lot of high margin uh revenue out of the quarter and probably out of the first half that was on top of uh some cost uh pressures of of our own making which we need to uh we need to improve upon but i think in in in power i believe that the team is doing a very nice job working off the uh the the so-called inheritance taxes driving real cost improvements you see that in the head count reductions here in the first quarter uh and as we get to a more normalized service environment i think you'll continue to see that uh that turnaround continue to um to take flight i think a renewable julian it's a it's a different dynamic uh yes we had uh phenomenal revenue growth in the quarter doubled the uh the onshore uh turbine deliveries here in the us got a bit of a little bit better price about a point of price which is encouraging to see but uh it is by nature a a very low gross margin business so the growth isn't high calorie unfortunately we had a a a few uh what we figure one offs but they're not one off until they go away permanently uh cost and execution issues all the while the uh the turnarounds in hydro and grid are are i think moving forward but it's really to and they have a number of inheritance stacks that will take a few years to uh to work through so i i think the cost actions that we have talked about today will accelerate those turnarounds empowering renewables they're dealing with different uh dynamics in the respective businesses um and that's really why i think i have the the confidence to say that you should expect the detrimental margins sequentially uh to improve the restructuring and the cost actions should present themselves uh and and and and improve detrimentals in the back half but we've got work to do to make that uh to make that happen great thank you from what research we have natural coe please go ahead thanks julian thanks good morning everyone and uh <unk> great to see you on board um so look we appreciate all the color in in the slides and this additional color in the in the queue um so it is larry is it now a base case that industrial free cash flow will be negative and maybe just address the risk of significant uh you know uh cash burn this year uh or you know is there enough on the on the cost out and and the working capital so to maybe mitigate some of that pressure and keep industrial free cash real relatively steady yeah i i think what um i think what we're trying to to share this morning nigel is that um you know probably three things one we we've been very we've been hit hard and fast here right in uh some of our uh most important highest margin businesses be it aviation and services particularly um gas power services uh pdx in healthcare we think that that uh gets gets worse before it gets better particularly here in the second quarter with a full uh a full effect it's uncertain as to uh how things play out from uh from here uh we're gonna acknowledge that uncertainty hence the uh the the the pulling of the guide uh but we're not gonna sit back and hope that it all passes we're not gonna take the view the uh we've got a sharp v balance coming hence the uh the two billion of cost actions we've talked about in the three billion of cash actions we're gonna do everything we possibly can uh to control our destiny here without an pairing the uh the long-term value and the long-term trajectory of our company uh so we're telling you what we know today uh we wish we uh we knew more but that is really the uh state of play right now and and the approach that had stuff that we're taking to it okay i appreciate that larry thanks and then um you know i thought one of the one of the real highlights of the quarter was the underlying strength of the healthcare margins uh you know x even x biopharma especially given some of the headwinds you face in there so we see and strength and small equipments and and pressure in the guide how does that mix look though when you when you look at the the the the the mix on smaller you know patient monitoring equipment et cetera versus the guide how does that equipment mix play out to the margins well we uh we we certainly i i think the the key thing to keep in mind nigel is um the the big iron certainly got hit um the the the lower um uh the lower ticket the lower price points be a patient monitors ventilators and the light certainly got uh quite a boost but it's a it's a small part of the uh of the of the business uh so there was a little bit of mix there um but but not a lot it was really more function you know frankly of of the team doing a nice job more broadly recognized is that absent biopharma uh we needed to tend to the core cost structure in all its form um in the hcs business right we we've been growing healthcare uh biopharma leading the way we got some good margin support from that business the last several years well now as we think about the seventeen billion dollar core the teams really i think put their sites the last couple of quarters on growing that business growing it with a creek of margins and it's really the cumulative effect that that i think you see a bit here in the first quarter before we uh uh we we got hit we got hit a little bit later not as much uh you'll see more of that unfortunately here in the second quarter uh but i think you've got a team who thinks that like many other med tech companies they can grow mid or low to mid single digits over time and put more digital into the mix better cost that should give us the opportunity to grow with a of margins along the lines of what karen laid out in december and i i have no less conviction about the ability to do that uh today than than we did when we made that presentation again mindful that we've got some uh generations here in the in the near term to deal with right okay thanks very good luck hey thanks <unk> hey guys uh we are at the bottom of the hour so brandon we're at the bottom of the hour so we can just take one more question sure from rbc capital markets we have dean gray please go ahead thank you uh good morning everyone wishing everyone good health and had my welcome to carolina thank you hey just morning dean good morning just two questions uh both aviation um a lot of discussion about structural cost out and larry be interested in how have you balanced the uh the structural cost out in aviation with rips and and balancing the riffs and furloughs versus how you might be compromising the ability to bounce back uh when it does ramp back up so that's the first question and then the second one just to make sure i heard it correctly were there uh did you quantify the leap cancellations in the quarter i know there's delivery deferrals our experience in two thousand eight was that you did not see many outright engine cancellations cause customers would lose that not refundable deposit so what's the expectation here in terms of engine cancellations that's it for me thank you being maybe i'll take the first part of that and for us carolina can take the second um i i i think we are mindful uh ever mindful that there will be a recovery right and we wanna be well positioned for it's gonna be very good business for ge for for um decades uh but i i think we are really trying to again embrace our reality uh and take the the cost actions in the aftermarket business and more broadly at aviation uh mindful that we've got a period of time here uh of an unknown duration but it's it's not gonna be measured in months right where that business is gonna be under considerable pressure so after a a a period of time as the after market uh has has grown as it has the last the last decade uh this is gonna give us an opportunity to uh to rethink to re to validate all the while uh mindful of our obligations to customers uh the nature of how the footprint has changed uh the changes that are probably still still still coming so there there are a number of variables uh it's it's very much a work in progress as well but i think we've got line of sites to build on some of the temporary actions to uh to take permanent uh action to make sure that we we have a lean cost structure with a adequate capacity to uh to come out of uh the downturn here uh well positioned to perform both for customers and for investors thank you we'll now turn it back to steve would occur for closing remarks oh do
