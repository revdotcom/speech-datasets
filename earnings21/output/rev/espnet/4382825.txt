mode later will conduct a question and answer session during the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone please note this conference is being recorded i'll now try to call over to ms ellen <unk> ms den the sentence you may begin thanks narra hello and welcome this morning to our listeners i'll first introduce the members of the

officer we have dominic maclin our senior vice president of strategy exploration in technology and nichols our senior vice president of global operations brian will open this morning with some prepared remarks and then the team will take your questions before i turn the call over to ryan a few reminders in conjunction with this morning's press release we posted a short deck of supplemental material regarding the quarter onto our website that's available for your access next we will make some forward looking statements this morning based on current x expectations as well as statements about the proposed business combination announced last week between clinical phillips and concho a description of the risks associated with four looking statements and other important information about the proposed transaction can be found in today's press release all of which are incorporated by reference for purposes of this call we'll also refer to some non gap financial measures today and reconciliations to the nearest corresponding at measure can be found in this morning's press release and also on our website thank you and now i will turn the call over to ryan uh thank you all and then good morning to our listeners uh before we get into our third quarter results i'll take a few minutes to address last week's announcement of our combination with control resources we spent a lot of time talking to the market over the past several days and i'm pleased to say that the feedback has been positive by the way earlier this week we added some annotation to our transaction deck for clarification today's call is a great opportunity to reflect on our conversations and reiterate the compelling merits of the transaction for both sets of shareholders i'll start at the highest level announced a transaction with concho combines two widely recognized leaders in the sector conco phillips has been a recognized leader in the returns on and returns of capital model for the business and concho has been a recognized leader in the pureman pure play class yet while we're both best in class companies on a standalone basis by scaling up our existing returns focused business model we are stronger and more investible within the sector characterized by free enterprise cycles industry maturity capital intensity and esg focus will be a nearly sixty billion enterprise that is uniquely positioned to create sustain value by embracing what we believe are the three essential future mandates for our sector and these mandates are first providing affordable energy to the world second committed to esg excellence and third delivering competitive returns we believe that transaction accelerates our ability to successfully and simultaneously deliver on all three of these mandates that's how we will win now let me take these mandates one by one in the context of our transaction in all future energy center we know the world will need hybrid carbon as part of the energy mix for a long time even as we see increasing adoption of low carbon energy sources however we also recognize that the energy transition means the winners will be those companies with resources that can be affordably developed in a transition in any transition scenario including a less than two degree scenario that's the reason we've always been committed to having the lowest cost of supply resource base in the industry the company will have a twenty three billion barrel resource base with a cost of supply less than forty dollars a barrel concho gets the benefits of our global diverse and lower capital intensity portfolio attributes conco phillips gets the benefit adding some of the best resources in the world and by the way we've studied rock quality everywhere now let's move on to the second mandate a commitment to esg excellence in conjunction with last week's transaction we announced about thing a paris aligned climate risk framework were the first us based on a gas company to do so our framework includes specific emissions intensity reduction goals a commitment to no routine flaring permanently installed methane monitoring and advocating for a well designed carbon price in the us this framework is in service to our ambition to reach a net zero operational emissions target by twenty fifty now we've been asked in our engagement meetings if this framework included the portfolio effects of the contra assets the explicit answers no we were preparing to issue our new climate risk framework before the transaction was agreed however we see the addition of conscious assets as being consistent with and a creative to these goals the production emissions of the us on conventionals are among the lowest phd intensity assets in the world so the addition of these resources will be a benefit to our projections plans and targets now the third mandate delivering competitive returns is an imperative for attracting and retaining investors to the sector our company has been all about returns and that won't change in fact the combined company will be uniquely positioned to deliver on the proven returns focused by proposition we know investors want from our sector because of several advantage attributes and demonstrated priorities for example as i just described a transaction creates a massive resilient low cost of supply resource base i discussed this as part of mandate one but also add that low cost of supplies the best assurance by definition for delivering competitive financial returns through put cycles after the deal closes we'll publish our combined cost of supply i have no doubt it will be best in class by the way we've been asked about how we do risk in the event of a change in leadership in washington our view is that while it might create some headwinds for the industry our company's global diversification and our mix of private state and federal leases in the us assures that we are competitively positioned for that outcome and we accounted for this potential risk in our evaluation of the overall transaction diversification and low capital intensity matters and as i just mentioned we preserve those portfolio characteristics adding conscious unconventional assets into our portfolio will not make it zero difference to our base decline rate that means we retain our diversification and low capital intensity advantage for the benefit of both shareholders will apply our discipline consistent approach to future investment programs capital will be allocated first on a basis of cost of supply and then based on secondary criteria such as flexibility capital intensity asset optimization affordability and free cash flow generation in our expanded per program resulting from the transaction will be integrated within the total company plan to optimize overall outcomes and value the combination creates greater visibility on earnings expansion and free cash flow generation back in our announced five hundred million targeted cost and capital savings the transaction is a creative on all key consensus financial metrics including earnings free cash flow and free cash flow yield finally our on balance sheet plus free cash flow generation means we're even better positioned to give investors what they want from this business returns of capital the transaction enhances our ability to meet our stated target of returning more than thirty percent of our cfo to our owners annually and this target isn't an ambition it's what we've been doing for the past four years in fact we returned over forty percent of our cfo owners over that period and it will remain a key part of our p you're offering the bottom line this transaction creates a best in class competitor scale to thrive in a new energy future that is compelling for shareholders for both companies now a few comments on what to back next our s four filing should be filed in the next couple of weeks and we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of twenty twenty one integration planning is already underway dominic <unk> will lead the effort for conco phillips and we'll draw we'll lead the effort for concept both sides are excited and committed to a very successful integration as part of the integration planning we'll begin to evaluate how best to optimize our future investment programs we would expect to announce proforma capex for next year shortly after closing but directionally on a standalone conical phillips spaces we remain cautious on the pace and timing of recovery so as a place to start we're currently thinking we enter twenty twenty one capex at a level that is roughly similar to this year's capital meaning little to no production growth on a standalone basis of course we retain the flexibility to adjust as the year progresses we have the capital flexibility the balance sheet and the ashan hand to respond as necessary to changes in the macro while meeting our capital return priority and that brings me to a few comments on the third quarter results it's certainly been of all the year for the business as we all know the company took some significant actions to respond to the downturn including production curtailments and over the past couple of quarters we also carried out our major seasonal turnarounds so a bit of noise in the second quarter and third quarter numbers but by the end of the third quarter that could the program was behind us this season turnarounds were complete and the underlying business was running very well that you saw this morning's released third quarter results were in alignment with expectations we've reinstated guidance that you should think of and he should take the fourth quarter as the new baseline for twenty one capital and production those i just mentioned that subject ongoing monitoring and market conditions we look forward to keeping updated on our integration progress and our future plans for the business and finally we hope everyone's safe and well and i'll turn it over to the operator for q and a thank you we will now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone if you're using a speaker phone you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers once again if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone when being on standby for any questions and our first question comes from field rush from jp morgan please go ahead your line is open yes hello um first question i just wanted to ask about the quarter here um it looks like there's some moving pieces around cash flows uh affiliate distributions and some other factors there so i was wondering if you could give a little bit more color there and help us think about how you would define the clean cfo in the quarter yeah thanks phil i'll let bill bullet can answer that for you thanks hi phil so yeah for the for the quarter cash from operations x working capital was about one billion two hundred thirty million and we had a couple of one time benefits in the quarter a legal settlement and an audit settlement totaling a hundred thirty million of that but we also uh uh had curtailments in the quarter of about ninety thousand barrels a day so the foregone cash flow for that would've been about a hundred fifty million dollars of cash so if you think of a clean run rate number for the quarter good place to be thinking is about one billion two hundred fifty million for the quarter now you you asked about equity distributions we didn't have a distribution from apl and g in the quarter we received distributions uh through the second quarter of about five hundred million from apl and g and the remainder of the year we're expecting a little under two hundred million in the fourth quarter that would give a full year distribution of somewhere around six hundred eighty to seven hundred million for the year okay great very helpful um i guess this kind of dovetails in my second question which is um you know we continue to get some questions here around this performa cfo guidance that you provided um and so if i look at the results you just talked about the one point two five uh and what contro reported the other night which i think x hedges around five hundred um perhaps you could help us bridge these results which i think we're about forty one dollars wti to um to the seven billion forty dollars wti guidance you provided yeah thanks phil i know there's a number of moving parts there as you described and uh yeah we've had a few people point out that they bought the seven billion it forty dollars a barrel for the combined company looked a little bit light so now we've seen the third quarter if you adjust for conscious hedging benefits and what bill just described on our equity affiliates i think you get something closer to the mid to highs seven you know it it forty dollars so maybe i'll let matt add a little bit of color to uh those details yeah they they uh if you if you look at the clean third quarter um the uh for for both companies they'll explain the the errors they would imply somewhere between seven and a half and seven eight at forty three dollars about now that the range is basically they're based on the uncertainty and the equity affiliates district if we got similar distributions to uh this year would be the top end of that range um and these these numbers also include a proformer assumption that we get the full year of expected cost savings um that we announced which is two hundred fifty million of cash and that's what shows up in these numbers there's also the a hundred and fifty million of capital that doesn't then doesn't affect cfo directly does that does that help fill the i'll take that as a yes uh yeah hope so thank you our next question comes from doug <unk> from evercore isa please go ahead your line is open good morning everybody morning doug um well one of the the hallmarks line of kind of going fills before the merger and even after the split in two thousand twelve has been corporate agility is the way i'd like to think about it and the ability to create value and strategic transactions over the near medium term periods and on this point while you guys have been pretty clear about the operating and capital cost benefits that you're gonna get as well as some of the enhancements that you're gonna get from a higher quality investment portfolio my question is whether there are areas that you're optimistic about that may or may not be as obvious that stand to deliver further upside areas that you're really confident about similar situations that you had in the past with other transactions and then second what are the two to three most important things that you think that the new management group brings to the organization so two questions yeah thanks doug all the maybe start like dominic uh add a few comments you write uh you know when we put out this energy number we we see a lot of other energy numbers that people put out there and uh it seems like a fair amount of arm waving we want to be pretty specific about the five hundred million dollars that uh that we described but if you're the second page which i think is what you're alluding to a little bit that i can let dominic uh add on is we yeah we fully expect that we're going to get uh additional opportunity either through price uplift or various other forms to uh add incremental value to this transaction dominic maybe you could describe a little bit of what the integration team is gonna be looking at yeah thanks uh thanks ryan doug uh thanks for the question you know obviously we're very focused on the overing the five hundred million that we have put out there as a commitment but certainly we see opportunity beyond that i think we kinda outlined those in our in our deck uh i think just to talk more about those specifically i think one that we're most optimistic about you know on the marketing side control typically sells our product to the well head we sell further down the value chain to improve realizations so you know we have a very strong commercial group uh clinical phillips so uh we're certainly excited about about that you know control have been doing extremely well in the permit or they're doing completion costs the performance has been excellent and they're further down the learning curve than us there so we do expect to see that to accelerate you know the performance on our acreage too and of course we expect uh you know improved performance across the low forty eight from sharing best practices and technologies between eagle ford and the permian and the back and so on so definitely operational efficiencies and then on the supply chain side obviously we're gonna have increased purchasing power scale flexibility so we're anticipating you know uh upside in all these areas and and some additional areas too that that uh we'll be working on in the coming months here so will and i already talking about these we're pretty excited about it and uh we'll look forward to see how these develop through next year and maybe your last question uh doug uh so dominic mentioned will or and then what tim you know what we really appreciate out of what they bring to our company is some incredible permian expertise and experience they have the networks they have broader and deeper networks and we we really have in the permian given their long time association and presence there and what tim's built is a is you know two or three goes at it and what he's done over the last thirty years in the perming basin not that i've had a lot of conversations with ceos over the course of the last couple of years and what i've come to appreciate tim shares a passion for this business and a vision for what's going to what it's going to take to be successful over the next decade and beyond that is really consistent with with my view or our view but what it's gonna take uh to to really succeed and beat the competition so and then i'd say finally probably you know we're both very committed to a successful deal and we're both uh committed to getting the secret sauce that is konica phillips combined with the secret sauce that is concho and make something that's even better going for thank you our next question comes from <unk> from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open great thanks guys appreciate uh you guys taking the questions so the first is a follow-up on uh distributions including from aplg but just equity affiliates broadly just how do you how do you think about that you made a comment in the deck that we shouldn't expect that to be radical can you talk about different oil price levels and how we should be thinking about modeling those distributions coming into business yeah sure neil this is bill um i think it you're thinking about equity phillies but that we we've talked in the past and how they aren't rateable uh you should be thinking about the distributions from a p l and g in terms of being more significant in the second and fourth quarter and lighter in the first and third um but as you think about um going into next year and you look at more like strip prices for next year if you're thinking the range at six hundred eight hundred million from equity affiliates at those kind of pricing that's going to that's gets you into the ballpark i'll you see depends on how they're performing on on on terms of the markets and how we're um optimizing our capital over an a p l g but that'll get you pretty close that's great that wasn't it ryan as a follow up just just as a reminder you just as a reminder you know we do have a sensitivity for that in our price deck for the pricing that's right that's right yeah in the supplemental materials we included today it's great guys yeah go ahead and you'll get a second setup yeah was really just about alaska and uh i know we're a couple days away from the elections that was probably very sensitive topic but just sort of your temperature uh on on uh on the fair share act and just in general your your message around alaska and you think about the the cadence of spend and investment there yeah you bet i'll let uh matt's uh matt's been following that closely i have to but uh matt's gotta give a good answer yeah i know that they i mean as you know that that there are really three that's that topical just know there's the ballot initiative to increase the production tax there's a status of the willow project and there's the impact that they any of a change in administration if that happens on federal land permitting so i probably should talk about a few of them so that we can hopefully clear up alaska with this with this one that um question so as you know the ballot measure would improve that acts increase in production uh the uh and that's gonna have two problems to adverse effects it's gonna reduce the competitiveness of investment in alaska and it's gonna increase uncertainty and instability um so that that not going to be good and we have years of development opportunities left in alaska but a shift of capital from alaska tails here is going to be rational if taxes increase i mean this is a production tax and what your tax more you get less of so that should be expected that if it was advocating for this and important for the proposal should understand that and we've been pretty clear right so that we would to avoid any doubt in alaska if the measure passes drilling in the big three fields that we targets of the tax increase it's not gonna resume in twenty twenty one and uh and maybe beyond that so they uh you know alaska jobs contract labor all the associated services are going to be adversely impacted by this change and the contractors the unions all the other businesses up there understand us and they've proposed for the most part i posing they uh they're changing their tax regime but it's now up to their electric to decide and um elections of consequences so we're getting down to the wire here and we really feel as if we have to be we have to be clear with the uh alaska borders on the willow project itself the the uh we've we've passed a big milestone earlier this week we've got a favorable record of decision from uh the b l m after it's more than two years of uh process so that keeps us on track with the project timeline and and it's worth understanding that that that parent was received under the twenty thirteen uh integrated activity plan for the national petroleum reserve and those are rules that were set under the abama and then administration so they should stand up well to scrutiny under a change in administration if that happens so we're we're working towards that kind step selection and moving to feed by the end of this year professor simms the ballot measure uh fails and taxes are not increased at the passes will uh will need to reconsider the timing because a little well or isn't directly targeting by the tax increases there's gonna be knock on effects on the other fields because of the lack of available available capital and then the last one is the federal land and permitting in alaska the uh um you know more jim only if there's a change in administration we would expect that to have a relatively limited impact on us you know those sixty five percent of our acreage is on federal land only represents about five percent of our production now some coming production gmt two in particular uh is on federal land but it's well underway first production will be the end of the next year so we don't expect that there will be affected at all willows on federal land of course um uh but neither willow nor t t one or g m t two the federal land flow sites is uh nf and other than conventionals that stimulation techniques so if there is about fracking there they shouldn't be influenced by that um so and yes we've been clear with alaska electric about the implications of ballot measure one we expect any implications of the change in administration to and dc to have a relatively limited impact on us thank you our next question comes from janine wise from barclays please go ahead your line is open hi good morning good afternoon everyone thanks for taking your call um so that's good morning you mean good morning uh maybe sorry just one more on alaska if i could real quick following up on meals question um it it's a little bit different but i mean last year on the analyst day you talked about how willow would be contingent upon selling down twenty five percent of your position in alaska and we know that you need resolution on ballot measure one first um but is that twenty five percent sell down still the case now that you have concho assets in the portfolio and then maybe just on that um for the ballot measure one we know it's a citizen ballot measure and do you think that it could be likely that the legislature would potentially overturn any decision um yeah jimmy this is my again um uh we didn't we didn't really see it was that they explicitly tie a weather decision to a sale down um they they uh but but we we're still anticipating that we rolled a sale down in alaska we just slowed the timing of that down until we get some of these uh on certain twos resolved so it's still on the cards that will make an adjustment to equity um uh in the uh in alaska um but but we may still continue to proceed with the project in the meantime um so so so the the timing of the project doesn't injured on the cell down i guess is what i'm i'm seeing on the um uh ballot measure one and then can the the legislature overrule that um not not really no not not for picking up their time for that they would have to come up with a an auto not of that was uh that was um you know substantially similar uh or or the the uh and so it wouldn't uh it's unlikely that they would overturn it that they um you know lock stock and barrel uh okay great that's really helpful thank you very much um my follow up question is just on the cash allocation priorities and you indicated in your prepared remarks that twenty twenty one capex should be about similar to twenty twenty with little to no production growth um the strip moves around a lot kind of moving against this all today um but is the right way generally to think about it is that in the mid forty threshold that that threshold that you have for production growth it's a hard and fast criteria that need to be met or are there just a bunch of other considerations that we would need to factor into the decision making process yeah i think we you know as i tried to describe we basically use cost to supply and i think as we as we think about the forward curve we're thinking about our plans for twenty twenty and again i mentioned those on a standalone basis for kind of co-phillips that's kind of how we're thinking about it going into next year you know it's just not not cost to supply but it's also what what kind of cash flow are we projecting to to and uh you know we're we have the we have the benefit of a very strong balance sheet so we can use some of that should we need to but certainly we'd be also trying to balance uh the the cash we're making with the capex that we're spending in the in the dividend that uh today uh satisfies thirty percent of our return criteria and more given the kinds of prices that we're seeing so certainly some headwinds into the commodity price outlook right now some um you know with covid resurgence some demand certainly hasn't started to recover and depending on what opec or opec does on on the supply side and what the us response is you know we're watching all of that really closely to make sure that whatever program we put in place for twenty one we can balance with the cash flow that we expect and make sure that we're investing in the lowest cost to supply things that we have in the portfolio only thank you our next question comes from josh soberstein for and wolf research please go ahead your line is open yeah thanks guys maybe just just hearing all that that last question there you've mentioned that um you know for conic or standalone campus it would be very similar uh on a year over year basis what would the mechanical standalone lines look like relative to the fourth quarter twenty lines under that scenario and yeah josh said that we would it would be we'd expect it under that scenario to be um similar to fourth quarter or second half of the year sort of weeks at that sort of level so that that would be roughly four point three is what we're spending this year um which is a bit above our sustaining capital um with the data subject so i want to take an opportunity to clear that up the the uh cause flat production and yet above our sustaining capital so let me try to explain why that's different so if we were if we were going to execute a long term sustaining strategy for the company um they they we'd need about three point eight for for for clinical phillips standalone and that was sustained production at one point where we fleet but you know that below one point two million bounds would be the uh um but with the low cost of supply that we have in the portfolio we don't expect that our long-term strategy will be to simply sustain production they they the the investment opportunities are to a competitor for that but what ryan is really indicating is that we could execute a tactical sustaining program much like we have this year and and start twenty twenty with that sort of tactical um sustaining program an nc how demand recovery and supply responses shape out and what probably the distinction between us our tactical and strategic and sustaining program is an a tactical sustaining program we would still keep production flat but we wouldn't completely shut down uh projects like willow or exploration activity uh those things were still continued with anticipation that they uh ultimately would move away from simply sustaining uh back to some modest growth so those are the things that we're working through just now on the uh in the plan um there's ryan said we shouldn't expect us to communicate twenty twenty one capital guidance certainly for the combined company until sometime after the transaction causes yeah i think uh yeah i would yeah i would add josh you know we have a lot of flexibility with the balance sheet which is why you know if we go in at a similar level of capital to this year it you know it may be flat to modest growth so it doesn't necessarily we'll flat production at the at the capital level going in next year but uh that's something we'll we'll continue to watch as the as the macro evolves around this gotcha and then you mentioned that the you know the lower forty eight assets i guess unconventional assets are the the lowest emission part of the portfolio and uh the conscious assets only add to that uh i'm curious what the highest emission asset is and does any sort of you know i'm getting something in the international portfolio uh um do you think about m and a and and that regardless as well as maybe those are awards investor candidates they kind of accelerate the build sort of get into your your twenty thirty path yeah so the the the parents the missions assets in the portfolio just now in the operated portfolio it's really it's a oil sands the uh that's why we're so focused on on uh looking at ways to bring oil sands emissions down and uh and we've got a lot of uh items in the fire there and we're gonna we're gonna extend their non-condensable gas injection which brings down steam oil ratio uh by keeping heat in the reservoir and of course it's a steam oil ratio that drives the emissions intensely uh we're also gonna be deploying um more uh s uh a piece of full control the faces uh they bring that brings their steam or ratio down we're moving to add some sustaining cards so some of the cards get older they're steam or ratio increases when you put new cards on that they're community a low stimo ratio and there's other technologies that are looking at there as well so what we're doing basically across the board is we're looking at all of our um uh greenhouse gas intensely across every asset that we have and we're asking ourselves what can we do um to cost effectively bring that down the the uh and that's what we're that we bring that process together and what we call our marginal agreement cost curve um and uh we have about a hundred projects and they're just not now some of them are are desktop exercises and it's like feasibility studies uh we spend about ninety million dollars this year between capital and operating costs on those projects um the uh um but we look across the whole asset base the the same thing we used to to bring that down in our targets josh you know that we established the thirty five to forty five percent reduction that doesn't require major portfolio changes to go do that so we're we're not talking about having to sell certain assets that matt described but that's that's things that we have identified inside the portfolio to work on with the portfolio being relatively constant over this time yeah it's actually that's a good point line it's mostly driven by the fact that we're uh there's a sort of strategic shift and we're we're investing we're investing in <unk> uh uh greenhouse gas intensity places like the unconventionals in the us and canada um uh we rolling up in alaska which is very low intensity as well so the percentage of our production that's very low intensity increases with time and when you combine that with reducing the emissions intensity of our existing assets like your oil sands that's we've delivered the the uh uh the reduction in the emissions and tends to do over the next ten years it's not it's not uh and i think that yeah and we've said that at some point and matt described sort of the the cost and capital is is is small amounts to get this plan we're not talking about spending hundreds means not as capital go deliver this this is uh small projects that uh that are currently baked into our plans uh thank you our next question comes from roger reed from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open hey thank you good morning morning roger just uh i'd like to to kick on really kind of a follow-up what you're talking about with josh there is you think about twenty one capex roughly flat and you said you know you have to be number next year for what it comes what i uh what would be the things you would be looking at i mean presumably not simply oil price up or down i mean it's i assume it's some macro factors um maybe help us kind of understand some of the signals you might look for for getting more optimistic in twenty one yeah i mean it would it would be uh natural we have to we have to see how the uh uh how the demand responds to you know what looks like uh uh have the slower response some people were hoping for um they especially with europe and then possibly the us coming so we have to just be cautious about that we have to look at how the uh uh the russia and opec can respond i mean they they they they they have a move coming up in the end of november uh and see when we go back to this or drawing down the inventory so the the beauty of our position is that we've got incredible flexibility we've got a little break even place to cover you know for flat production and to cover the dividend uh that's sustained from the two the two companies together uh so we're we're we're actually having that flexibility and the ability to respond to um for the market is going together is uh is is very helpful so we're not gonna rush headlong into you know trying to grow production into this that doesn't make any sense to us we'll see how things play out here over the next uh you know several months and then we'll make we'll make adjustments they they're then between their little break even and our balance sheet we'll be in the we'll be in very good shape to to assess that as we go through okay and i would add roger that sorry i would add roger that um well it's it's it's not so much even just what what's the strip look like or what what it looks like for next year it uh it's sort of the longer term trajectory back to what what we believe is is a reasonable mid-cycle price and what will be rested think what that mid cycle looks like depending on where the demand and the supply fundamental start to kind of shake out with the us title going down you know what happens to the election and and alaska and then uh you know it's gonna make it's gonna make imminent amount of sense as we combine with the concho to to optimize and figure out what the what the right level of activity is between the two companies so there's you're right there's a number of factors that will be putting into the mix as we look not only twenty twenty one plans but what the next couple three years look like as we as this business recovers back to a mid cycle and whether it overshoots or undershoots well it's oil industry so it'll definitely do one or the other and maybe both um one quick uh kind of follow up unrelated to the first question but related to the merger some of the savings uh that you that you cited were gonna be you know uh expiration appraisal spending doesn't have to happen i was curious for the assets that you won't be spending money on in the near future do they just go back into the resource base or is that something that maybe becomes more likely to be a uh disposed of you know monetized uh in a different way yeah roger it's dominic here thank you so um what we said was we will continue focusing our exploration effort on our existing business units such as alaska norway malaysia so that will allow us to about half our exploration capital from three hundred to one fifty so those those uh areas such as uh you know down in south america columbia argentina and so on we will be working sort of managed exits from those areas of course we have a lot of value there we see a lot of value there's a lot of good good acreage there but um we'll be working to preserve value as we think about uh how to um uh you know exit those areas in in the future so more a question of uh dispositions in a managed way rather than those resources staying in the portfolio we have such a strong portfolio we will with concho uh you know that uh we just think it's appropriate that we focus the exploration of it and we advantage those rather to whether there's not a there's not excessive capital employed associated with those assets but we'll as dominic said well we're gonna do everything we can to monetize them as best we can and and we don't have any resources associated with any of those assets in the moment in our supply code there's no resource associated with them thank you our next question it's from scott handled from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open thanks uh could you give us some color on you know n us natural gas price has been pretty strong and and is there ability for chronic to flex you know for that a little bit or is there you know where where is your opportunity outside of associated guests or is that really the opportunity yeah i think the main opportunity for that scott is associated get us we'll probably have a little bit in the antarcco basin but that's not capturing a lot of our capital right now so um it it mostly for us where it's still a pretty big uh uh big marketer so we uh we were moving you know over eight b cf a gas a day so we see a lot of that so we're getting we're getting some uplift on the commercial side of our business with some of the transport capacity we have that takes gas from the permian to the west coast and down south to arizona even even into mexico so that's how we're kind of taking advantage of of the kind of market as we see it today and but on just an absolute production side we're not looking to ramp up you know dry gas and it's mostly coming from the associated gas with in conventional production yeah could you could you quantify some of the marketing you know benefits you'll see track led bill uh he's head of our commercial organization to maybe provide a bit of cut are there yeah sure so uh um scott we we have a very active commercial organization ryan mentioned that we're moving a little of eight pcf a day with a fifth largest gas market in the us and we provided a variety of services to um very customers ranging from asset management agreements to top take agreements and that provides an ability to one have insight into the market and also to gain margin across moving across pipelines so we continue to look at that and continue to move and we're shipping gas for a a profit okay uh so you know of that eight hundred eight eight b c of a day you know five hundred million cubic for the day of it is ours the rest of the third volume and so we're in and out of the market on both sides on a daily basis thank you our next question comes from doug <unk> from bank of america please go ahead your line is open uh thanks uh good morning everybody um i wonder uh bill maybe i could start off with you and ask you to maybe elaborate a little bit on ryan's comments around the potential election outcomes and i'm gonna thinking specifically about tax um i'm sure you guys have looked at this but the thing that strikes me is a little bit disturbing is the potential for a minimum fifteen percent pnl tax that percent wells you know on that a bit of a spotlight so i'm just wondering if you guys have thought anywhere about that any scenarios that you've run outcomes that you may expect yeah sure um we've certainly taken look at um the various tax proposals out there including the biden tax proposal there's there's two primary elements of that that that would impact this doug it the first one is obviously change in the corporate tax rate from twenty one twenty eight percent and the second one that would be fairly significant would be uh removal idcs particularly in our capital program and and um needing to um appreciate those over time those are the two main aspects as look through it that really would have an impact on us yeah i guess i should have been clear i was talking about a potential biden administration and um maybe as a as a follow-up then and i know it's something that is a little bit too obvious but we don't maybe ask it enough ryan when when yourself and when mark put together the cable wave scenarios and all the other scenarios that uh that you laid out to the strategy day um we've no seen what we think is a lot of the signs of a bottom you know cycle coming to a bottom if you like with consolidation yourselves being part of that how does this what you're seeing right now beyond covid influence your thoughts on longer terms of the demand as you think about scenario planning i'll leave it there thanks yeah thanks doug i'll maybe add a few comments matt can jump in as well but um yeah we we spent a lot of time trying to think about what the trajectory of the recovery looks like and uh probably a couple competing factors we certainly uh see demand recovery we uncertain whether it gets fully back to a hundred million barrels a day but uh probably taking a bit of a bit of time to to get there and then uh i think equally important and maybe overlooked a little bit is what's happening on the supply side maybe masked a little bit today by duck inventory but um you know when the declines and the declines are hitting in and it was masked by curtailments coming back on you know there's gonna be a drop in us supply as well so i can uh matt can probably chime in and uh describe a little bit about the net effect to uh the scenarios that we're thinking about as we uh debate our capital program and how much to to put back to work yeah douglas i mean the the uh and i think you and i have discussed this in the past that the uh if you look at the uh air expectations for the eggs rate for this year for us tight toil is somewhere between six and a half and seven million barrels a day and they uh we'll we'll be able to get better calibration on that year than as it approached the end of the year so that compares to over eight million barrels of the ember last year eight point two um and and and to some extent that that drop flatters to deceive because people were still bringing wells on in the first quarter and into the second quarter uh the uh so there's a significant underly the claim going on here when we model this and i know that you do to um the there's strip prices in the in the low forties um we think the industry's going to struggle to maintain flat production at the ember's rates to twenty one and then to twenty two twenty one i'll get a bit of a lift from the ducks um but the uh but but people are going to live within cash flow it's going to be a real challenge to uh to see tight oil uh seven million bars a day and it's likely to be less than that in twenty twenty one and twenty twenty two if you compare that to the trajectory we were on that's at least four million bottles would be less than the pre covid trend and that's just us tight oil and we respond more quickly here because of the decline rates and the capital flexibility but that the similar issues are happening elsewhere so although there is definitely uncertainty and how much a demand effect will be um it's likely to be less of a demand effect than the supply starting over the next few years so look at the the premise of your question initially you know are we setting up for the bottom of the cycle here uh but certainly fuels out with us and they're they're exactly the terms will be dependent upon the um the uh uh demand um the covid and have got opened in the short term but the uh we're certainly setting up for a tight tighter supply demand balance in a year or so uh is not before that yeah so so short medium term all about demand medium longer term you know uh supply starts to enter the picture is matt described and uh we have a couple of couple of two three scenarios around how we how we what that uh slope and uh trajectory look like thank you our next question comes from paul chain from scotia bank please go ahead your line is and hey guys good morning um morning paul why why that uh maybe it's a little bit of the curve for here uh if we look at the treating and optimization or commercial operation historically is that the us looking at that actually call center mainly for facilitation the european on the other thing a more aggressive approach and looking at there that's a profit center and they seem to be doing quite well and have a good logic to train around your physical asset so from that standpoint uh will clinical uh should look at uh that operation and see whether that uh it will allow you uh to have a higher performance in higher term or that you think uh facilitation is that time you don't want to take on that swing and earning uh and the higher risk so that's the first question uh the second question uh with the uh less for arguments they if you decide uh your longer term ten year plan have changed uh due to a different market condition and that's such that your future growth rate is going to be lower uh with the addition of the control asset uh what outside in your portfolio uh we take more of the back seat and seeing lesser capital investment uh if you can say the uh the number one number two on that uh if that's possible thank you yeah so let me take the first one and uh maybe matt can chime in on the second one on the capital investment so the first one yeah you know we're looking at the commercial space and with the additional con show you know it is a as you describe paula kind of a cost center inside the company but you know we're we're looking at expanding that uh you know as we think about the future and what the contrast at spring i think is dominic described earlier they they mostly at the wellhead so we got some opportunity to add value there to both the gas and the oil side um we're building more export capacity as a company and uh and in fact have done some sales to uh point sales to customers where we take the middle man out of the the equation and we found that quite uh margin enhancing as we go forward as well so with the growing us production uh that we would have with the combination with con show it absolutely represents a uh uh a big part of uh of how we can expand the commercial organization and think about it uh differently too i mean we'll describe the market share that we have already and uh that's only gonna get uh bigger as as we go forward so uh we're looking for more contribution from the uh the commercial side across the whole whole portfolio uh maybe matt if you wanna take the capital allocation as a result of uh integrating the contract assets you know again i go back to it's a it's like a us to supply primary criteria that matt can provide a bit more details about what what might fall out yeah paul is that that as you know what we do is we try to optimize each of our individual into the end visual parts of the portfolio uh to get the optimum piece um using a set of decision criteria but the most important of which is that we're not gonna invest above an incremental cost of supply of forty dollars battle and describe that the uh the some length back in november of last year and so we look at the optimization of each and then we put it together and we uh and we maybe make a few adjustments but we're trying to honor the optimum in each of the assets um now there is for exability across the portfolio in the piece you can we can adjust the piece of any given project by universal we can adjust the rate of which we increase the ramp in the number of rigs so i wouldn't call out any specific asset if we decide that we want to grow at two percent instead of four percent or you know something like that the uh then the flexibility across the portfolio to do that and uh and still own our uh our criteria that that wouldn't bust the criteria the obvious places are low forty eight alaska that's where the flexibility mostly exists and maybe in canada as well but i wouldn't um i wouldn't really call it a specific asset but we're we're trying to do and we're trying to optimize across the portfolio but the the issue is if you're not optimizing across the diagram portfolio when you're uh you know maximizing the value that the diversification brings in so we we we uh um that's we're trying to do is to make sure that we're we're running each of these assets at the optimal thank you our next question comes from jeffrey <unk> from tutor pickering please go ahead your line is open good morning thanks for taking my questions my first one is on esg and the the paris align climate risk strategy and i i think your commentary earlier answered a lot of what i'm looking for you know with the oil sand specific examples and just your comments on investment decisions uh but is there anything incremental you can share at this point on other operational change that you're undertaking uh and focusing on for the broader portfolio just trying to get a sense for the scope of some of these projects you've mentioned again in terms of what's in focus whether that's you know new technology around monitoring uh retrofitting equipment for emissions controller or what have you yeah thanks it's uh dominique cale just uh take that you know um you know recently uh i i was uh very much involved in the low forty eight and and there's some really um some some input and progress we're making there i think um you know i think that we we uh announced a couple of things here along with our new uh paris aligned uh strategy and one was um you know uh commitment to zero are a routine flaring and that's the world bank initiative there so we've committed to that and the other one was your introduction of continuous methane monitoring so this is a real breakthrough for us we're able to do this now at very reasonable cost and we're able to know basically on our key sites we'll have this implemented i think we'll have about sixty five percent of our low forty eight production covered um by early next year and this technology is very low cost a lot us to uh sample the emissions around sites uh looking for methane every fifteen seconds and from that we can respond very quickly to any uh operations that we can address very quickly so the the those are um a couple of really important in this just for us that contribute to that overall uh commitment we have to reduce um uh phd intensity by thirty five to forty five percent uh by twenty thirty and we really have first mover on this as you'll know uh jeff you uh we were the first uh us based oil and gas company to set a ghg intensity target and uh were the first us based oil and gas company to uh to commit to being powerful and thank you our next question comes from <unk> from raymond james please go ahead your line is open thanks for the question uh two quick ones both uh regarding in europe uh i guess it's about ten percent of your gas volumes you know no one is accustomed to seeing north see gas prices below three dollars in mcf but we've had that the last two quarters uh is that uh is that a covid related uh demand situation or is there something more structural in that market yeah i think that this is bill i think that you think about that that's that's more what we've seen with covid related and demand related issues right now as we think about long term the macro supply around the world uh we we we would see markets uh tend to more arbitrage office a us gulf coast with l and g markets starting to move volumes both into europe and into asia's incremental barrel so i think that what you're seeing is a short term response to supply demand and not a long term structural change okay and to follow up on that um in about six weeks the european climate law will be approved by the eo leaders which will make the norc the one part of your portfolio that that has come or by a net zero mandate uh does that change anything in terms of how you were thinking about that asset you know given the decarbonization targets uh for uh the eu as a whole uh no not really i think we're continuing to make adjustments what over left within the europe portfolios or norwegian assets and uh you know some of the lowest uh carbon intensity assets we have that are offshore and looking at other options to continue to uh reduce our emissions through electrification and uh additions there but as we look at it it's it's minimal addition to the cost of supply and it's quite manageable and norway still is very a competitive in the portfolio this is ellen we'll go ahead and take our last question if you don't mind thank you absolutely thank you our next question comes from phillips johnson from capital one please go ahead your line is now open hey guys thanks just one question for me and it relates to your future return of capital to shareholders um in the last five years you guys have purchased a little over ten million dollars with a stock at an average price of around sixty two a share so at today's share price the paper loss on that program's pretty substantial um i realize you guys plan to purchase more stock here in the fourth quarter but i wanted to ask if there's any appetite at the board level to uh to scrap the idea of sherry purchases and instead uh pursue a fixed plus very little dividend strategy that would um that would target paying out of certain percentage of your free cash flow directly to shareholders each quarter yeah i think the you know the most important thing is your last piece of that we're we are targeting over thirty percent of our cash back to the shareholder that's what we've committed to and over on in excess over the last three to four years since we kind of came out to establish a new value proposition for this business and i think the dividend today is certainly covering a large share that also think that buying our shares back this kind of level is is an important thing to do too because uh shares are certainly well undervalued it's certainly relative to where we think mid cycle price should be so i don't think we'll give up on share we purchases completely he made a real point i mean we we wanted to buy by our shares through through the cycle and uh this was a pretty significant downturn with curtailed production and and the light going on in the second quarter so we did suspend for for a while we wanted to restart up because the the benefit to really buy your shares is not just buy 'em when you're at at at at mid cycle price but continue to buy 'em through the low low end of the cycle because that's what brings down the average cost your your shares obviously so we still think it uh it's gonna be a piece of our return to shareholder pie and the question begins you know what happens on on future access returns when if if there's another big cycle and uh we we start to exceed our mid cycle price call and uh we've had conversations around that with the market and we continue to look at all the different ways to do that and continue to be open to all the different ways to do that but at this ten seconds uh the dividend more than satisfies our return to shareholders thank you we have next one awesome at this time i'd like to turn the call back over to ellen thank you great thanks and our thanks to our listeners by all means uh reach back to us if you have any follow-up questions and we really appreciate your interest in support and conical phillips thank you thank you and thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference thank you for participating you may now disconnect yeah
