necessary to pick up your handset before per see this dark piece to allow for as many questions as possible we ask that you each keep to one question and one follow up our first question comes from the line of andrew lazar with bar place please proceed with your question great thanks so much more everybody good morning andrew hi um you know i'm curious for the for the past several years michelle and the majority um if not all of the companies you know organic sales growth has come really from pricing as opposed to volume or consumption growth um and my to this is obviously due to the success of the company's new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity that that comes with it i guess that said as you look forward into twenty one and beyond i'm curious if there is a sort of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the two drivers and if so you know would you expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year thanks so much yep andrew absolutely i think we've shared before that you know we do view pricing as an important part of our growth album of them but we are very focused um and would like to um drive to greater balance between price and volume you know we have good visibility into uh q4 and twenty twenty one and we do expect volume trends to end proof part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing elasticity from last year and also a continuation of some of the strong share games that we've seen to date that will carry into the first part of next year i think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year and we feel good that the calendar programming we have the innovation the media is really gonna help to drive some of that great great thanks very much thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of ken goldman with jp morgan please proceed with your question hi thank you um along the same lines of twenty twenty one if i hey michelle you can you pull back a little bit on advertising this quarter it's been a little up and down um this year for for uh understandable reasons i'm just curious what your thoughts are in general on what the company's plan is for advertising marketing in general as you get into what hopefully will be a more normal year in twenty twenty one sure so we definitely believe in investing in our brands that is a critical piece of our growth model on the business so clearly as we mentioned to you we had pulled back on some spend in areas where we just thought given the pandemic it didn't make sense for example in refreshment where we knew consumer usage was down significantly but as looked at twenty twenty one and as we've started to you know see the momentum that we're seeing and some of the recovery you know we definitely plan on um taking our investment levels to where we would like them to be and more in line with where they have been historically so you'll see us um really leaning in to to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we're seeing thank you and then for a followup um you you didn't do any air re purchases this quarter i think that's the first time in uh two years and that was the last time it was right before you bought um pirates booty i i want to ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal of course but i am curious how you would describe the current environment for potential transactions i guess particularly our targets may be more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales number than usual or are they more hesitant because they i guess kind of wanna ride this demand wave as long as they can do you want to take that one yeah i'd be happy to so first just on the share reference i will just echo what you said don't read anything into that i would say for this year we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general you know going back to the beginning of the year in the covid um phase uh just taking a little bit more cautious approach uh we will be revisiting that as we look at next year and i would say in general our capital allocation priorities haven't changed with respect to m and a specifically it's probably more in the ladder i think people are still the ones that are the most interesting are riding a wave and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre covid if not higher but i would say we're continuing to have an active funnel continue to look at a number of opportunities and we'll continue to take the market as appropriate great thank you both thank you our next question comes from the line of robert moscow with credit sweets please proceed with your question hi thank you um i i think the um uh the the recovery uh expected in twenty twenty one uh in international and other is um you know you have a two percent headwind this year and twenty twenty uh but can you uh give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in mexico and india and china um is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic impaired your commercial capabilities at all um or the retailers um desire to merchandise confectionary products um in those markets yeah so first of all i start if i say certainly there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic we all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of you know occasional increases of spikes in markets around the globe that that said i would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in international our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment and i think that you know we've seen while each market is a little different and the use of the categories a little bit different consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust and we've done a great job over the past couple years building the the hershey equity so we were pleased with the rebound that we saw in many of our markets i think i mentioned in india our business was now up six percent versus it had been down we gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category so i had i wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis um you know just as we are pivoting in the us i think we've pivoted to where the opportunities are in international and we feel good about the um the recovery a and you know plan to continue to deliver against that um thanks can i can i dive a little bit deeper into mexico um are there any um packaging um uh requirements that the government is making on on nutritional values or uh any concerns about um uh about uh the category uh how that might impact the category yeah absolutely so the government did put in place front of labeling changes in mexico and that new packaging is now in the market and we are beginning to monitor the trends um we believe consumers know our categories of treat they know it has sugar and so we expect that we'll see less impact from that then perhaps other categories will but we will of course keep a close eye on that and i would say mexico has been one of the harder hit developing markets relative to covid so we feel good about the progress we're but it's a little slower than some of the other markets okay very good thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of david palmer with a record isa please proceed with your question thanks uh good morning and uh a question on your share gains in in the us and particularly in chocolate uh you you really and in your prepared remarks you touched on this how adaptive you were by market by channel by needs date in term in terms of smalls some of that's related or might be related to supply chain could you talk about that part of it and i think the reason i'm asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by a competitor maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in twenty one and have a follow up yeah absolutely so i would say i believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands are uh consumer understanding our programming as well as to the supply chain execution and execution at retail both of which tend to be you know core advantages for us um as a company so i think we're seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers and as you mentioned we really pivoted with the consumer so very early on we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing and we've off to all of you before about the fact that our category splits a third a third a third take home instant consumable and seasonal and as we saw consumers shift to more at home behaviors we very early on shifted the folk us in our portfolio to really dial up some more twizzles for movie nights um you know our baking product activities and then within the seasons even with halloween we made that decision to lean in and drive and build a halloween in season versus back away from it and and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early so we can get consumers in in pre-trick or treat um you know let's make sure we are smart about the portfolio that's out there and not overly index to seasonal skews et cetera and then we worked really hard on messaging to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday we dialed up e-commerce as consumers shifted to e-commerce and because we had an us did in capabilities in that we were able to do that um and then i think uh a lot of the strong investments we've made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well and some of those go beyond supply so you know we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends we've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level we've made media investments to target better and certainly we've invested in our plants fall along the way which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocols and really be able to continue to execute and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail so as i think about you know think about that share gain i would say clearly we would expect to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of twenty one we would expect that they would moderate after that though we're certainly expecting to to hold on to share and we will continue to drive our outstanding programming and and also continue to execute supply chain with excellence that's helpful thank you and then just on any sort of one times from this year that that we should be thinking about from a model perspective i'm thinking about covid related friction costs this year but also you might add back some sgna in parts um in other so any one time type comparisons that we should think about thanks yeah i think we talked about it in the repair repaired remarks on the top line we had about a two point impact so you can right away there's a drop through that two point into profitability but then if you take a look at the net of cost for covid so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had early in the year and you net them against the dme optimization the media optimization that we did as well as the t and e savings there was a net slight positive on those two pieces and so that we would expect to mostly go away we'll have some lingering costs next year probably less one off in any quarter related to covid ppd and so forth that continue uh but net was just a slight positive outside of the two point drag on the top line thank you thank you our next question comes from line of chris growing with <unk> please proceed with your question hi good morning good morning hi i had a question for you if i look back at uh halloween i'm curious if you split this season apart and you had given some information on this uh last quarter um sort of the early season part and that trick or treat season part kind of how each piece perform if you can give it a little color on that we have some information from iri but i'm curious if you have a better information that we have and then i'm i'm also curious is i think about that early part if that's more indicative of what you expect for the holiday season as we move into christmas and that kind of time where you don't have a trigger treat event um could that early season if you start that that season early in particular in stores be more like what we saw in the early part of halloween if that makes sense yep so clearly we saw that within the season the early part of the season performed more strongly uh and the later part that's more trick or treat focused performed a little bit softer now we had anticipated that so overall the season performed exactly in line with our expectations um as we look at the total season we were are quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus year ago as was our sales room up versus year ago so during a time of the global pandemic i think it speaks to the resiliency of the category and the consumer's desire to re we hold onto and continue to celebrate the traditions and fun occasions like this in their family lives as we look at holiday holiday is has some different consumer dynamics than halloween and so we've leave it'll behave a little differently i don't think we're gonna have some of the pressure that we anticipated we have coming into halloween um the category should be quite strong consumers use the product in you know in different ways it's much more about family occasions we aren't as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard hit so we expect solid results um given that skew to at home consumption uh okay thank you and then i'm just to follow up with that that are you shipping in shipping in holiday product early and would that have been an incremental benefit do we see some of that in the third quarter more than we would've seen historically yeah we did just like we did with halloween started shipping in holiday a bit early so you do get some pickup in the third quarter for that that'll take away a little bit from the fourth quarter you know maybe on the order of fifty basis points and we also that to drive the consumer behavior early as well just says we did with halloween um you know as halloween was still on the floor holiday was also out there so that consumers could also you know gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly so yeah yeah strong halloween self really helps us because it helps us get that fast start to holiday because it clears the space to be able to put holiday on the floor okay thanks so much for the color there absolutely thank you our next question comes from the line of jason english with goldman sachs please proceed with your question take good morning folks congratulations on a good quarter both well i want to pick up on the back of chris's question and and keys out try to teach that a little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward um the the halloween early part selling was phenomenal much better i think i didn't expect it i think a big part of that's due to the merchandise and programs that retailers had it seems like they start bigger and earlier than they usually do um has has that you think influenced how they're gonna approach other seasons going forward so said said more directly you expect retailers to provide more more merchandise and import behind the category into how are they into easter than the otherwise would coming out of the success they saw in halloween so we've always had pretty strong merchandising support at every season and one thing we always think of out with seasons is when we get it on the floor because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or seasonal product whether it's east or wherever early for in-home consumption if you get it out there it kind of sparks a trigger of you know fun moments earlier so i don't know that i could say specifically that um we can anticipate that retailers are gonna merchandise it even more than they ever have um i do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that you know is a bit more stable um there were a few retailers you know as you can imagine with the uncertainty of halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with halloween really had to be made in early may when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants and all of that so there were a few retailers who had pulled back on halloween and based on the results of the season this year they will likely have more confidence going forward which should help to make for an even stronger halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other season it's like easter that that makes a lot of sense and then one more question on the um i'm sticking with follow on to chris's questions which i thought was solid um the the the early part of the season versus the latter part of the season um the earlier part of season was exceptionally robust um and you said late part was a bit softer but in somewhere in your remarks i think you said all in total holiday so both early part and late part finished down mid single digits for the cat i think mathematically to get the category down in single digits we're gonna have to see some pretty pretty sharp declines um coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we as we capture that late part of the season if i'm thinking about it right am i interpreting your comments for yeah yeah yeah you are interpreting them correctly um so category was down the single digits overall as much as our business was actually up um and we will see some of those declines yeah you very much well just one other thing to just keep in mind there is a little bit of a timing impact from the neilson and ira data given that the season was on a saturday versus a thursday and based on retail recording days so you will probably even see it's down even more and you'll have a week will kind of mid november so you see some of the those last couple of things being reported so some of it when you see will be just the timing shift because of the day of the week and some of it will certainly be the the declines and in trigger treat at the end understood thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of david <unk> with ed research please proceed with your question great thank you good morning and congratulations on uh great execution in the quarter thanks david i had uh two question and the first one just a two relatively small ones on the other expense commentary i think through the through the year to date period other expense is is only a very small number but your full year project a hundred to a hundred and ten million dollars on that means that the fairly massive number in the fourth quarter am i doing the math right is that is that correct on how the the pattern lays out for other expense and then related just another follow up on your volumes expected in the fourth quarter i think in your prepared comments he said north american organic growth similar to third quarter but pricing only like a half point so that would mean volume is something like five percentage points positive in the fourth quarter my doing uh those two pieces right any color you can give on those two comments yeah be happy to do so on the tax side and other expense here exactly right we will have a large other expense in the fourth quarter uh that's consistent with what we've been saying even in the early guidance or later in the year and then along with that a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter to do the math on the tax rate you also have to solve for a lower tax rate so that's how the those two lines will play out and yes on the volume up in the fourth quarter you're thinking about it the right way we do have some invent replenishment that will happen in the fourth quarter we saw that in the third we'll see some more of that or that continue into the fourth we're also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year and then this continued strong share gains those three things are part of driving that with quarter volume michelle bigger picture question first she took pricing in most of the portfolio outside of seasonal candies in twenty eighteen and then in twenty nineteen given the negative impacts to halloween for the entire category would you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions maybe just gets delayed to twenty twenty two or sometime later until we get a normal consumer environment essentially i'm just asking you to assess your your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing actions it's a weird environment and i don't know how it's altered that calculus thank you yep so obviously i can't speak to any spec about our specific any upcoming specific pricing actions um what i can say is you know there's been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller more frequent increases and that doesn't necessarily mean we're gonna have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time you know we did for example um actually have a small pricing increase this past year on our food service business in the third quarter so you know if we look over time we have been able to price at various times um at various economic conditions um so what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm but as we've talked about before we really want to grow through balance to grow across levers distribution velocity innovation uh price et cetera so um you know we know that uh that that is certainly um the one piece of the portfolio that we we have not yet priced and i think it's fair to say that you know given that we haven't announced a price increase at this moment in time the magnitude of pricing in twenty one would be less than we've seen in prior years at least at this point um yeah we've been pleased that we've seen conversion be pretty good this year even in a very difficult economic environment um and i think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years which is the category is very resilient our brands are strong we continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power really helpful thank you so much thank you question comes from the line of steve powers with 3g bank please proceed with your question yes hey thanks um good morning i i guess building uh somewhat on earlier questions i'd love a little bit more color around your general mindset heading into twenty one as you work through your planning process um clearly there there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year international movie theaters venting specialty et cetera and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead but at the same time you can get you a lot of share you've had a great success uh in at home categories like baking and with initiative like smarts um all of which is fantastic momentum but you know again could set up for difficult year of year comparisons um so as you size it all together i guess is there a way to to frame your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just know each other out in your mind or are you approaching twenty one planning thinking we've got you know either a net easier or net harder set up versus what um you know what one like and through typical thanks yeah so we're pleased with the momentum that we are seeing and i would say you know your call outs and what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business i think are very accurate um you know we believe we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers um and especially at a time like this where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness moments of happiness we're really pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment and we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting so know this year obviously it was consumer shifted to take home and so we dialed up some mores and we dialed up twizzlers and we dialed up baking and we you know leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity you know giving consumers new ways to bring has paid halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards and all the creative things people did will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions and they have just evolved you know as i mentioned we were able to dial in and accelerate e-commerce and i think as we look to next year we are prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them i think we've built and we've demonstrated the ability to execute well during this environment and also to pivot from an executional perspective whether it's at retail or in our manufacturing facilities so we're very focused on that you know we've captured as well some you know cultural um um positive effects i think capabilities we've built in term of operating in this environment that you know perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly and you know we think that is an enabler for us going forward so so we feel we feel good about the as we look to the future thanks for that michelle um i don't know if you wanna take this one or steve but i just as a follow-up um sort of unrelated just any comments you might have on on just current levels of promotion the promotional environment and what you expect to see there of the balance of four q and and into twenty one thanks yeah we don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity um we didn't really see it this year we didn't execute anything significantly differently and nor do we expect to see anything in the future okay perfect appreciate it thank you our next question comes from line of nick moody with rbc please proceed with your question yeah good morning everyone um so michelle i was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with google that you use during the hollowing period and you know do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday season but also kind of in your everyday business as you kind of look forward you know we are continuing to um to leverage different types of data and analytic and insights more and more across the business and you know we continue to really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment and leveraging data analytics to tailor copy to tailor messaging to tailor media so more and more we are operating at a more sophisticated level relative to use multiple data sources and also using that to reach consumers at the right places with the right message at the right time and i guess what i'm trying to get at is you know is this kind of new way of of kind of targeting consumers like the return that you see from what you've done like can you just give us any kind of understanding um because one thing i'm noticing across the entire cpg landscape is companies are spending more money but they're spending more money on the same message and in fact you know new consumers are being recruited you know you indications are changing and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers and so i find this you know google's partnership you know incredibly compelling for you guys so i'm just trying to get better context on how it's changing the return profile of your spend you can provide any context on that so we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media we always have we've had strong media roi forever and our challenges how do we keep making them better and then we continuously optimize based on that so right now you know it's a it's a big spend area for us so it's an area we're very focused on elevating and it is about you know making sure right now i would say some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting and then once you have that target the ability to alter the message so and then we alter our media mix accordingly and i would say we we see you know significant movement in that mix on a year to year basis as we get better at that i think we've raised you know some of the opportunities of how we've gone just very deep relative to um specific seasons whether it's similars by zip code or whether it's specific you know holidays and looking itself through at a store level um basis to be able to dial up media on a zip code level basis so you'll you'll continue to see more of that frankly that's just becoming a way of of how we operate now great and last question just from an innovation standpoint can you just provide any context on kind of what's remaining in terms of innovation this year and how things are gonna work in twenty twenty one if there's any clarity you can provide on on the launch timing yep so we feel very good um about our innovation um some of the innovations that we are excited about um that are you know new to market include the reese pretzel product a reese cup with pretzels in it um we've had a range of cat flavors we know on a global basis a big part of the cat portfolio our flavors they tend to do quite well um we are on a very small uh level uh launching snack cakes um under a resource trademark which you know delivers that risk experience in a slightly different type of product um and we feel good on that versus basis some of the early test results um and we will have more coming some items um on our take home side of our business that won't get announced until early next year which is typically the time we announce those things just given reset windows um no major change in our innovation strategy we think it's working very well for us we think it's right sized um and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results great i'll pass it on thank you thank you our next question comes from the line of my delivery with piper sandler please proceed with your question thank you good morning good morning you you've talked about the the increase in e-commerce sales uh even if it it might have decelerated a little bit but it's it's up very strongly uh you've said in the past the baskets and dollar ring are higher online is that still holding true with the growth that you're seeing now and on the margin side you've mentioned that there's a small gap but that it that you were narrowing it and that scale would help that is is that coming along the way that you would've expected how does that look now yeah i mean we've generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are you know doing fewer trips and you know more quantity per trip so i think that's been somewhat of just an underlying dynamic given the the pandemic impact in the marketplace um for us on our e-commerce business we've seen very significant growth across the board but particularly in click and collect where people actually go and and pick up their their uh groceries and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national deliver um the margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks and mortar okay great that's it's those two areas excuse me in those two areas where we have you know similar products obviously that we sell in brooks and mortar that's right steve anything you wanna add yeah i would say is that you know we've said in the past that overall e-commerce margins are a little bit dilutive and it's there as michelle just said in click and collect and local delivery very similar not much impact and that's probably two thirds of our e-commerce business the piece that is more dilutive is the shift to home and in particular cold ship and that's a where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align okay thanks and i just wanna follow up on smores i thought that the your your data analysis and insight there to to to push that the way that you did was was interesting as you're seeing you know cases rise again now are you replicating that are you seeing similar results is there's a small search we should expect and it would be right to assume that those hershey milk chocolate bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you have so we have really expanded some more from at one point it was a very focused time of year to really capturing some more as a year round opportunity especially if you especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country um there are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that so we're very focused on that um you know we're also very focused on the upcoming baking season where we know that consumers will be spending time at home it's already a natural baking season and so we'll be looking to really optimize we're able to drive you know leveraging insights around that season as well okay great thanks a lot thank you our next question i'm fine i'm fine i'm fine with bank of america this is a good question hi good morning everyone um so so just just one one question for me and i think there was a little bit of a commentary in the um prepared remarks about uh some you know inflation and cost of goods sold so maybe steve could you just give us a kind of a a lay of the land right now in terms of um you know what commodity costs and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently um you know in the context of seems like freight costs are going up you've had some competitors talk about uh coco prices going up uh so just trying to get an understanding of you know directionally where where inflation is headed right now sure yeah for us i say overall it's been relatively stable so on the commodity side relatively stable you know you saw big movements in commodities across q2 and q3 and of course we've talked in the past we mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program and i would say to they're fairly stable uh there are increases in freight costs there too our team do a great job of uh longer term contracting uh which helps mitigate some of that increase so that hasn't been a real material impact for us we have seen some increase warehousing cost and part of that volume and flow through along with the share gains and and the volume increases that we've seen uh so we called that out in the prepared remarks but in total we sitting at this point uh you know would say overall cogs is fairly stable and we'll get more guidance on twenty twenty one when we get into the fourth quarter call but i guess we can infer from that at least from where we sit today that you know that it's stable is something that looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes i think that's fair you know next year as we get the you're gonna have the twenty twenty and twenty twenty one crops of coco start to bear the lid so you know there's that to consider um and then there's other things obviously on the gross margin side we as michelle said you know we'll have a little bit more volume driven then price driven mix driving gross margin next year we'll have our continuing productivity goals uh and again a lot more on that to come when we talked on the fourth quarter call all right thanks steve that's uh that's very helpful have a happy thanksgiving everyone thank you thank you our next question comes from line of john bob gartner with wells fargo please proceed with your question good morning thanks for the question good morning morning um michelle i like to follow up on the the to snack it you know you mentioned that it's small right now but you know first you went down this path about fifteen years ago and it didn't really translate into anything material so i'm curious what the data tells you in terms of changes to the landscape now does this maybe mark a new phase of the snack section evolution and i guess where do you think it slots in i mean does it compete against the twinkies the cookies just you know where's the target market you know any any big picture thoughts would be appreciated yeah absolutely so you know i think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way which was um not a mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time but we did a very targeted in market launch for nx ended period of time so that we could really learn about the proposition we spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in this snack cake area um and we also really thought about you know where where and how we wanted to play and launch so this for example is very c-store focused um it is you know a a single serve type of items so we're keeping it as a as a focused launch um it is definitely bringing the great uh chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on reeses to the snack cake markets so yeah it is you know playing in that snake snack cake area versus other snack cake brands um we know that we had participated in this category for many years through licensing and we learned through that that our brands could participate and extend to the category we also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening so this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth because that is where the snack takes get utilized um so again we're gonna have a very focused rollout we'll put it in locations where we think we can uh garner incremental space and where we think there's a strong consumer fit and um starting at cst and looking at other select areas and then if it continues to perform well we will expand but we will watch it closely and take a measure approach great thanks michelle sure thank you our next question comes from the line of alexia howard with bernstein please proceed with your question good morning everyone hi alexia hi that can i just talk about the uh the c store channel specifically uh it's obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic uh but i imagine that there has been some sequential improvement uh in there could you maybe just give us uh uh some numbers about how that channel uh is uh is recovering absolutely so as you said we've continued to see strength and food and mass and dollar as consumers eat more at home um the c-store uh class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter so we saw uh the business grow in the low low single digits in the third quarter which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends um it did then slow a little bit as summer ended in those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school um our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel uh and significantly ahead of the category so we have share gains of about a hundred twenty basis points um in q3 in that channel so um you some some some rebounds and some recovery versus versus where it was in the past as people are out about a little bit more than they were great and and then as a follow-up um follow-up on brian's blame question about freight costs i remember back in twenty eighteen as great cost spikes back then that quite a bit of a headwind for you um it seems as though it's not so much of a problem this time around uh are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of cogs uh freight to actually write events um and how much about is already contracted out and what you've learned since twenty eighteen to make the situation this time around um a bit more manageable thank you sure so yeah freight costs right now we don't see as a material impact if it continues to rise it'll have a bigger uh bigger impact right now again because we're contracted our teams do a great job of managing those contracts uh it's not having as material of impact you it's roughly ten percent of cogs overall and so it's not a material but right now not seeing enough movement there given the contract and to really drive a material live back on overall cogs great thanks you very much i'll pass it on thank you our next question comes from the line of jonathan phoeni with consumer edge please proceed with your question good morning thanks very much and thanks for a great halloween i personally personally and professionally you know the venus of my financial ambitions has been to give out full size candy bars which i was again able to execute so thank you um two two quick ones uh i noticed in the data a pricing in north america is plus one nine on the takeaway plus three three is what you reported is that just the math or is there some you know shrinking or different mix within retailer margins that is my first question and secondly uh historically when you look at today's velocity is generally tomorrow's distribution and your velocity's been fantastic this is a weird year a lot of people's velocity is fantastic but do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that every a day place you know you look at these you know baking items you look at these take-home items like this is phenomenally better velocity forget about just the total sales that you're seeing there you anticipate significant share gains perhaps structural ones uh i'm talking share of shelf here as retailers uh do resets for holiday and going forward thank you sure so two parts to your question the first was around um price and um some of the discrepancy and yes there is a mix impact um honestly it might be best if melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that because there's some complexity associated with it um but um the pnl is is definitely accurate um as it relates to velocity um yeah good velocity i i like your phrase today's velocity smart distribution i do think that's very accurate as we look at um the seasons you asked about holiday you know we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution incremental skus throughout the year um both in terms of every day and seasons because we've been able to deliver and the items that we then put on shelf um not only could we supply them but then they moved so um we do feel good about that you know we'll continue to take a very disciplined approach and be very careful that we don't overscale um so we really have to look at the the productivity of every skew and as long as it's good um we will be there but yes we have been able to to gain some distribution and and going forward i anticipate that we will can continue to be able to perhaps even through the first part of next year thanks very much and i'll follow up with melissa very good thank you our next question comes from the line of ken <unk> with bmo please press with your question hey good morning everyone good morning we can i just have one quick question everything's been asked and answered you you make a reference in the in the prepared remarks about pirates duty is tracking ahead of your strategic plans can you talk about what are the key learnings that you've developed you know through your years of the ceo that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and you know implement it what are your key learnings and what do you take full word to future learning the future acquisitions well so uh i think a lot of learnings along the way i guess i would start with um you know there's a business model for brands at that we as a company are best with and that is you know branded items where you know brand matters where the business has significant scale you know probably close to that a hundred million dollar mark and it needs to be a business that has a high gross margin because that's what that's what our business model is we're a branded company we invest a lot in marketing and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow invest and grow and we that's that's our model that's what that's what we need so i think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset um i think secondly um really understanding the strengths of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dives on which kpis we think um predict the ability for a brand to scale and then i would say um you know really trying to scale the business well and i would say hey we've learned lessons the whole way along the way as you know in the past we bought some businesses over too small we bought some businesses that you know had lower margins and we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well and i think we've had a very focused effort on the scaling as well and we've gotten much better at that um relative to supply chain relative to the talent that we need when we buy a company like this where we wanna keep the entrepreneurial spirit we wanna keep people who know the brand and the business um but we also have to be focused on the point that we're also at a point where we wanna scale the business so i mean i go back to the scale the branded nature the high margin are probably the biggest ones and then picking the right um underlying kpis that that say it's a sustainable business cause if we can do that um we can make it home great i really appreciate it thanks stay well thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes our question and answer session i'll turn the floor back to ms pool for any final comments thank you all for joining us this morning i will be available after the call to answer any additional questions you may have have a great day thank you this concludes today's conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for
