about uh eighty percent and the twenty percent of our portal uh advertising revenues respectively uh in currently two three our brand are advertising revenues increase uh sequential basis uh this study growth was mainly due to the gradual recovery of our uh offline promotional campaigns and the original ip programs it's more offline activities continue to take place in the remainder of twenty twenty we expect our brand advertising revenues to actually uh double digit growth the first quarter uh however only other hands uh our performance space the other housing continue to face challenge during the soda quarter mainly due to uh i think it's a following two factors uh first some of our clients or subject to stricter industry regulations and the year for uh they had to adopt a more cons active at a placement strategy and uh secondly the overall supply of either inventory in the market exceeded the market demand uh which which made uh raising the uh ecp of performance based advertising uh more difficult uh the sector uh the top five industries covered by our advertising business uh also e-commerce fmcg financial services and the internet services those industries which have traditionally accounted for a substantial portion of our advertising venues uh including auto and uh uh digital were mostly impacted in the first half of the year however at the pandemic grad

is on the uh advertising uh uh probably on the advertising prior to unify some grand ass can you update us call kpm looks like they compared to last quarter or a year know and what direction do you think simply and will go in the future and try to thank you okay thanks this is charles i will answer the first part of the question maybe uh i worked in at a few more works on the other person camp uh uh auburn laws for the first nine months of twenty twenty was r and b seventy three point eight million which is much lower than our operating loss of rp two hundred forty eight million in the same period of last year as such we are now on track to achieve our operating target for the four year however give the impact of the pandemic our top line performance in twenty twenty we do not expect

right so maybe uh i work and add a few more words on this i frank latest edward speaking uh uh actually as i have i previously mentioned the uh opinions question you know uh looking forward as the other work has in the industry uh is still full of challenges uh i think that like uh it's a first uh it depends on the development of the academic uh worldwide uh especially in china in uh within next year it's getting better but uh it's still a question right and uh so in this kind of uh macro uh economic uh environment we think that the advertising industry is still still facing challenge maybe in uh is in the first half of twenty twenty and uh also this uh in the other online advertising industry is evolving and uh uh users spend more and more time on platform like uh uh going and quite sure this kind of show from video uh platforms so uh our advertising uh incomes are still facing uh pressures especially uh for uh the uh how to make our advertising more cost effective is a big challenge for us and uh but so we uh as i also mentioned before actually we have uh recognized the list kind of changing in uh market dynamic uh we already uh put a lot of effort and uh in like the showfund video and the e-commerce spaces so next year uh there will be challenges but we also feel very excited and the confidence uh we think we can handle these challenges and make some uh uh progress in other regards in these days thank you brian okay thank you thank you once again if we should ask a question please press star one for the questions at the time i would like to hand the
