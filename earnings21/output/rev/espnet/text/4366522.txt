release issues this morning containing financial results for the quarter end of june thirty twenty twenty and the company's filings with the sec and with that i'll turn the call over to dr todd brady our president and chief executive officer thank you josh one good morning everyone as our industry and healthcare first responders continue working together to defeat the worst public health crisis in a century our thoughts are with those affected by covid nineteen the seemingly relentless spread of the novel coronavirus has made twenty twenty a tragic and surreal year but we remain hopeful and confident in the abilities of our industry to develop the therapies net necessary to extinguish this viral and disease i again want to especially thank our team for their work and dedication to our mission developing first in class medicines to improve the lives of patients with immunological diseases whose conditions are not being adequately treated by the current standard of care from our perspective the key pipeline development to the second quarter was our type c meeting with the fda which charted the remaining clinical pathway to an nba submission for topical ocular reproxo app in dry eye disease the meeting culminated in an agreement to use levels of reactive outer side species or rasp that therapeutic target for reproxo app as an objective sign in point for subsequent clinical evaluation in the fourth quarter of this year we plan to initiate clinical testing to assess activity of topical ocular reflect to app in reducing peer levels of rasp and other objective signs of dry eye disease and we expect preliminary results by the end of the year the timing of the clinical trial is of course subject to find elevation of trial design as a development and potential disruptions due to covid nineteen initiation of a safety study in dry eye disease patients is also planned for the fourth quarter and nda mission is expected by the end of twenty twenty one our optimism for the use of rasp as an objective sign of dry disease is supported by data from our successful phase two a trial in which would proxilab treatment diminish levels of rasp tier rasp and tears as measured by eliza following twenty eight days of treatment for the upcoming rasp trials the longest duration dosing under consideration is also to eight days whereas the shortest dosing duration is one to two days additionally the upcoming ras trials will include a chamber assessment to measure the effect of acute changes in dryness on rasp and others signs and symptoms of dry eye disease we'll be sharing additional details of the protocol following rasa validation and fda requirement and look forward to providing trial designs shortly from a safety perspective topical ocular repox lab already has been evaluated in more than one thousand patients with no observed safety concerns in short the safety consistency and clinically a significant activity of a proxy lab across numerous clinical trials suggest that a proxy lab could be an important addition to the limited number of therapeutic options for dry eye disease which affects more than thirty million patients in the united states looking at other ocular programs in our pipeline top line results from the phase three invigorate allergen chamber trial of a proxy lab and allergic conjunctivitis are expected in the first half of twenty twenty one in the retinal disease area the second quarter of this year the european commission granted orphan medicinal product designation to adx twenty one ninety one for the treatment of retinal detachment of been a new market opportunity for adx twenty one ninety one and the european union is drugs receiving the orphan medicinal product designation are eligible the protocol assistance research funding and upon approval ten years of eu market exclusivity eighty x twenty one nov twenty one ninety one our novel and proprietary intravitrial methotrexate injection is being evaluated in the phase three guard trial for proliferative vitreo retinopathy pvr is a rare but site threatening condition and the leading cause of failure of retinal detachment surgery affecting roughly four thousand patients per year in the united states a nearly twice as many in europe in japan come bond given the nature of pvr and given the clinical site delays caused by covid nineteen the progress of guard has been slow although we expect to provide you with an update by the end of this year as many of you know there is no approved therapy for pvr and adx twenty one ninety one has received orphan drug and fast track designations from the fda adx twenty one ninety one is also this objective our new clinical program in primary vitreo retinal lymphoma or pvrl a rare aggressive high grade cancer that affects approximately twenty nine hundred people in the united states with about six hundred new case is diagnosed annually there are no approved treatments for the disease although the standard of care is pharmacy compounded methotrexate that has been injected into the eye we have recently filed for orphan drug design asian for eighty x twenty one ninety one in pbl turning to our systemic disease programs we are very excited about eighty x twenty a x six twenty nine which to our knowledge is the first systemically in available rasp inhibitor the clinical testing of which represents the first time systemic rasp inhibition has been assessed clinically marking an exciting new milestone in the development of this novel mechanism of action an i n d has been filed with the fda for phase two clinical testing of adx sixty nine in patients with covid nineteen in order to prevent cytokine release syndrome and respiratory compromise clinical development is expected to begin this year in an animal model a cytokine storm eighty six twenty nine demonstrated a broad and highly statistically significant reduction in cytokine levels including tnfl interfere on gamma and i l seventeen while up regulating the key anti-inflammatory cytokine i l ten the data suggests that rasp inhibitors have the potential to represent immunological switches which may modulate immune systems from pro-inflammatory states to anti-inflammatory states in the fourth quarter of this year we also expect to initiate clinical trials of eighty x sixty nine in psoriasis us in autoimmune disease and atopic asthma and allergic disease in combination trials in covid nineteen psoriasis and asthma cover the gamut of inflammation and the results of the trials will carry her eyes the immune modulating activity of adx sixty nine and rasp inhibition more generally switching to adx sixteen twelve our novel hsp ninety inhibitor enrolled event has been completed in the investigator sponsored phase two udaro trial in ovarian cancer regarding the eighty x sixteen twelve covid nineteen program consistent with fda feedback additional preclinical and antiviral testing of dx sixteen twelve against sars covid two the virus that causes covid nineteen will be performed by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases which has accepted our request to evaluate dx sixteen twelve and in vivo models we plan to update on the eighty sixteen twelve covid program by the end of twenty twenty we approached the midpoint of the third quarter in a strong financial position enhancing our flexibility with recent common stock sales the two healthcare focused funds perceptive advisors and identity partners these transactions raised grow proceeds of approximately nineteen point five million completing are previously announced at the market offering program we expect our cash runway to be sufficient to fund operations through twenty twenty two including potential reproxial approval in dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis now with that i'd like to turn the call back over to josh for the financial review thanks dod for the quarter end of june thirty twenty twenty we reported a net loss of seven point five million compared with a net loss of thirteen point three million for the quarter end of june thirty twenty nineteen net loss per share with twenty five cents for the quarter ended june thirty twenty twenty compared with forty nine cents for the same period in twenty nineteen losses have resulted from the cost of clinical trials and research and development programs as well as from general and administrative expenses research and development expenses were four point nine million for the quarter end of june thirty twenty twenty compared with ten point seven million for the same period in twenty nineteen the decrease of five point eight million is primarily related to a reductions in clinical and pre-clinical development manufacturing and personnel costs general administrative expenses were two point two million for the quarter to june thirty twenty twenty compared with three point one million for the same period in twenty nineteen the decrease of nine hundred thousand dollars is due to lower personnel related costs including stock-based compensation and other miscellaneous administer rate of cost in the second quarter of twenty twenty total operating expenses were seven point one million compared with total operating expenses of thirteen point seven million for the same period in twenty nineteen as of june thirty twenty twenty cash cash equivalence and marketable securities were sixty six point two million subsequent to june thirty twenty twenty twenty five point two million in cash was received from at the market offering program sales to perceptive advisors ability partners and other investors based on current operating plans cash cash equivalence and marketable securities as of june thirty twenty twenty plus the additional at the market offering program proceeds are expected to be sufficient to fund operations through the end of twenty twenty two including potential nda approvals for proxy lab and dry disease and are conjunctivitis assuming positive clinical trial results and planned nda submission acceptances and approvals use of cash cash equivalent and marketable securities are also expected to include the continuation of the art one of the phase three guard trial in pvr and phase two clinical testing of adx six twenty nine an orally administered ras inhibitor in inflammatory diseases now turn the call back to todd for closing comments thanks josh we have a number of milestones planned for the second half of twenty twenty and look forward to executing on our clinical development strategy across our ocular and systemic programs looking at our ir calendar next week we'll be presenting at the b t i g virtual biotechnology conference and wet bush pack road virtual healthcare conference these events will be webcast please check the events and presentation section of our website for details we always look forward to meeting with investors and hope to connect with you at these or other upcoming events as always we remain committed executing efficiently in our strategic plan and bringing to market novel therapies that improve the lives of patients with serious unmet medical needs with that josh dave and i will be happy to take your questions operator okay at this time if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your telephone keypad that a star wants to ask a question your first question comes from the line of louis penn with cancer hi thanks for taking my questions here so first question i have for you is could you get into more detail on significant the fda's recognition of grass as assigned for dry eye disease is and what that means for you in terms in terms of potential approval and market opportunity and then the second question i had for you was on your covid trials how adaptive are those trials in light of the constantly evolving landscape for the treatment of covid and then how's enrollment gone and then my last question here is you noted that there's been some headwinds to clinicals trial progression due to covid can you give more color on which trial may be impacted here thank you good morning louise and thanks for your excellent questions the last development is a truly transformative for eldera uh rasp is the pharmaceutical target upon which the company was founded many years ago uh to our knowledge no company has ever therapy equally addressed rasp and yet rasp represent a very broad-based anti-inflammatory approach that probably applies to many many diseases not only ocular diseases such as dry eye disease but all so systemic diseases so for all those reasons we were thrilled about the fda decisions to classify rats as an objective sign of dry eye disease which as you know is an inflammatory um conditions what it means practically for the company is that the uh ongoing clinical trial the clinical trials that are about to start regarding the assessment of ras should be uh uh likely to work based on the fact that the mechanism of a proxelab and our other rasp inhibitors is the direct inhibition of rasp these compounds buying coveillently to wrap so what we're really measuring is a kind of whole reaction uh in vivo and in this case in the a care fluid of patients that have been administered reproxulab um and all that leads us to believe that will be in a position to file an nda for dry disease uh next year as we have uh previously announced regarding uh the covid trial designs uh we anticipate for both programs enrolling approximately thirty patients i think they'll likely be a two to one randomization drug to placebo at this point we have not included adaptive designs i think the nature of the results of these first trial else will help us determine subsequent clinical testing which is obviously going to be much more uh significant uh if there are positive results uh from the preliminary outputs that we have here um enrollment hasn't started the eye and d has been filed for sixty nine as i mentioned on the call today uh sixteen twelve is the subject of uh further um uh in vivo investigations um uh in covid that is being performed uh by nyad and we're absolutely thrilled about nyad's decision to um to test eighty x sixteen twelve on our behalf um the covid impact as you mentioned we across the has been significant uh the one trial in our case in our pipeline that has been affected by covid nineteen uh as the guard trial the phase three guard trial for pdr uh what's team to have happened during uh the peak of um uh covid cases at that march april may and so forth was that many patients simply were not coming into the hospital despite uh vision changes despite losing sight uh the um uh number of patients coming in uh was diminished uh during that timeframe and furthermore many clinical site as you know simply did not have research staff uh which were considered for a while to be non-essential such that it was a difficult if not impossible in some cases uh to enroll to enroll patients however the good news is regarding the rest of the pipeline we do not seem to be have been overtly affected by covid in terms of enrollment uh the dry eye program was largely uh under discussion with the fda uh during the peak number of cases uh in the spring uh the allergy program the phase three allergy program uh was on a planned hold because of pollen as you know you cannot enroll allergy programs with ambien pollen and we expect the invigorate program to uh reinitiate again in the fall so we were quite fortunate in terms of timing with regard to our other uh clinical programs believe um uh relative to the impact of of covid okay thank you as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star then the number one on your telephone key pad that is star one to ask a question for next question comes from the line of justing them with auburn hammer and company hi good morning guys thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress um i know it's early days but you know as you think about establishing a product left action on rest as a sign of dry eye we've had some discussion with investors on what would be an appropriate duration of observation to assess the activity can you just talk a little bit about the rationale behind the acute versus four week time points from a trial perspective uh disease perspective and labeling perspective all right good morning justin um and good to hear from you the as i highlighted in my comments uh this morning the potential range of dosing duration for the rest trials is anywhere from one to two days on the acute end to twenty eight days on the more chronic or sub chronic end which reflects the phase two a trial that is the data in our corporate deck showing that after twenty eight days of administration of a proxy lab that we the highly statistically significant reduction in rasp levels as measured by eliza i wanna spend a few seconds talking about the two different ways to measure ras ras exist in our body and two forms so called pre-wraps that are rafts that are sort of floating around and then rafts that are bounds of proteins the eliza measures wraps bound of proteins and as you know eliza is an antibody mediated uh detect assay the reason why we're able to generate antibodies to bound grass is that when ras bind the proteins their antigen and form antibodies in some cases antibodies against self protein so the eliza measures bound rasp and bound rasp generally accumulate over time which is why in the phase two a study over twenty eight days we use the eliza to assess rasp levels on the other end of the spectrum of regarding one to two day or acute dosing of her proxelab we think that uh techniques such as lcms aspect might be uh more relevant to assessing ras because there we'd be looking at free ras levels that would change acutely uh following dosing so somewhere within those two ranges of dosing paradigms and those two different assay techniques um we will end up validating the precise technique and and uh then uh establishing protocol design uh for the uh first of the ras studies to begin shortly okay great got it um and maybe then you know how do you think about dosing regimens to be investigated and have you had conversations with the fda on you know whether you'd have to do sort of you know q i d or b i d you know just to appreciate that you would be tapering and sort of the disease state eventually right and and that gets back to the first part of your question how might the clinical community perceive uh duration of dosing and dosing regimens um first of all i think that uh signs of diseases including dry eye disease are primarily or first and foremost regulatory milestones i do not believe certainly in the case of dry eye disease that or physicians or patients are particularly worried about signs patients do not wake up in the morning thinking i wonder what my shermer test is i wonder what my corneal stain is and so forth it instead we view signs and i think most patients and physicians use signs as regulatory um uh milestones so the dosing paradigm for trials associated purely with signs i think is a lot less important um and this case for one to two doses day one to two day dosing paradigms you're thinking of of a limited number of doses for the twenty eight day dosing paradigm i would expect we would dose q i d which is the first phase of our induction maintenance dosing paradigm which was established with the release of the phase three renew trial uh back in uh december in terms of how physicians look at the dosing paradigm a reproxalab in general uh in terms of treating patients i think that uh the induction maintenance paradigm established with renew over twelve weeks uh really sets the tone and and more likely the label for how the drug will be used and that is uh a q i d dosing initially uh followed by b i d dosing uh for the maintenance space okay that's really helpful um maybe just the clarifications i i i know in the press lease it says that it's uh gonna be a dry eye nba filing um by the end of next year is the current thinking still to continue on or with a concurrent filing just you know i know later it says that ac both of any files just wondering if the expectation is that you would expect them together still our current thinking is that both will be filed together pending positive clinical data of course it turns out that the time lines for dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis continue to overlap um the safety studies the efficacy studies the timeline for filing the md mda all of those seem to over lap uh for dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis at this point uh would suggest that a concurrent nda is perhaps the best regulatory strategy but of course we'll have to see how um events play out uh over the latter part of this year and the early part of next year before we can guide specifically on the possibility of a concurrent nda we really do like the concurrent nda paradigm however because of the overlap between dry eye disease and allergic conjunctivitis there seems to be about a fifty percent overlap such that about half of the patients with dry eye disease complaint of ocular itching and about half the patients with allergic conjunctivitis complaint of dryness and and a single compound that could treat both diseases or as indicated for both diseases would be highly advantageous not only to physicians but also to patients as well right great that makes a lot of sense um my last just uh you know on the safety study is there an expectation for what the size and scope uh you know duration as well a number of patients you would you would anticipate for it right for dry eye disease um the the current understanding is that the fda generally requires one hundred patients complete one year of dosing uh however um uh based on um other risk other sponsors interactions with the agency we believe that we can file based on six months of safety data so what happens is most sponsors will over enroll they'll begin with more than a hundred patients uh such that uh they have a hundred completers at um at twelve months uh and to our knowledge the uh the safety trials are um are fairly standard in dry eye disease um i will say as i mentioned in my uh prepared comments that we've tested uh well over a thousand patients uh we have seen no safety signals no changes in intraocular pressure no retinal findings uh no average corneal findings uh or any other safety uh uh signals that would suggest that there uh has been an issue with uh rex left dosing and any patient that's received drugs so great great thanks again and i'll hop back in the queue yep thanks jackie and there are no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to dr brady for closing remarks well thank you all again for joining us today as always we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress have a nice day thank you thank you ladies and gentlemen that does conclude today's conference call but thank you for your participant shouldn't ask that you please disconnect your line
