good afternoon everyone and thank you for your interest in constellia let's turn to slide five at customer the health and safety of our employees is our first priority we have implemented many initiatives to protect our employees in response to the covid nineteen pandemic we have provided our personnel with personal protective equip increased cleaning and sanitation allowed for and enforced social distancing and worked to raise wellness with our employees i want to personally thank our employees for taking this seriously the and following the precautions we have put into place as of last friday approximately one half of one percent of our employees have tested positive for covid nineteen and all of them have recovered or are recovering needless to say we must remain vigilant during the second quarter our plans operated well despite the significant disruptions to customer demand from lockdowns in both europe and the us as i'm speaking all our plans are running now and well we are carefully monitoring covid nineteen hotspots both for the health of our employees and any potential impacts on supply chains the demand and for our products gradually increased during the course of the second quarter and this trend has continued into july however both levels of demand and visibility from our customers remain below historical levels we took strong actions to combat the effects of the pandemic on our business we aggressively reduced our costs including flexing variable costs to match production levels reducing fixed costs and lowering our targeted capital expenditures over forty percent of our workforce where on subtype of partial employment or temporary lay of scheme during the quarter where appropriate we have also implemented permanent head count reduction our ability to flex coast was slightly better than the scenario we provided last quarter this was a great achievement by the entire constituent team and demonstrated our flexibility and resilience our liquidity at the end of the quarter was nine hundred and forty nine million euros an increase of over three hundred million euros compared to the end of the first quarter we added an additional fifty million in a euros of liquidity in july through credit facilities supported by the german state bringing our proformal liquidity to approximately one billion euros in june we access the debt market to refinance our twenty twenty one bonds this transaction removed our only near term bond maturity at a very attractive coupon in conclusion with the significant actions we have taken i am very confident in our ability to navigate through this crisis on five six you will see some of our highlights from second quarter of twenty twenty shipments were three hundred and ten thousand metric turns with decrease of twenty five percent compared to the second quarter of twenty nineteen revenue decreased thirty three percent to one billion euros of the roughly five hundred million euro decline in revenue compared to the second quarter of last year to thirds was related to lower shipments and one third was related to lower metal prices i remind you that while our revenues are affected by changes in metal prices we operate a fast through business model to minimize metal risk net loss of thirty two million euros compared to net income of seventeen million euros in the second quarter of twenty nineteen adjusted the beta of eighty one million euros decreased fifty one percent compared to the second quarter of twenty nineteen with a strong focus on cost control we're able to upset a significant part of the volume edwins to adjust to the better across each of our business units i i'm proud of what the team was able to achieve in a challenging environment from stadium generated two hundred and twenty eight million of just to be done in the first half the decline of twenty four percent compared to the first six months of last year our free cashflow was negative thirty three million euros in the second quarter of twenty twenty this result would not have been possible without our strong actions to reduce costs and capital expenditures and cash expenditures of all socks our free cash flow for the first half of twenty twenty was fifty four million euros based on our current view of market conditions we expect to generate positive free cash flow in twenty twenty and we now will hand over to peter to discuss our financial performance in more detail peter thank you john mark and thank you everyone for joining the call today turning now to slide eight you will find the change and adjust with uh by segment for the second call in the first half of twenty twenty compared to the same periods of last year for the second quarter of twenty twenty constellium achieved eighty one million euros of adjusted but does a decrease of eighty six million euros or fifty percent year over year part adjusted ebitda of fifty eight million euros decreased by twenty one million euros or twenty seven percent compared to last year a and t adjusted ebitda of thirty one million euros decreased by thirty three million euros or fifty one percent compared to the second quarter of twenty nineteen as and i adjusted vividda of negative one million euros decreased by thirty one million euros compared to last year lastly holdings in corporate cost of seven million euros were one million euros higher than last year in the first six months of twenty twenty conselling achieve two hundred twenty eight million euros of adjusted but uh a decrease a seventy four million euros or twenty four percent year over year part adjusted but uh of a hundred twenty four million euros decreased by fourteen million euros or eleven percent compared to last year a and t adjusted vida of eighty three million euros decreased by thirty three million euros or twenty eight percent compared to the first six months of twenty nineteen a <unk> of thirty three million euros decreased by twenty six million euros or forty four percent compared to last year lastly holdings in corporate cost of twelve million euros were one million euros higher than last year we expect agency costs of approximately twenty million euros in twenty twenty now turn to slide nine and let's focus on the park segment adjusted <unk> of fifty eight million euros decreased twenty seven percent compared to the second quarter of last year volume was a headwind of forty one million euros in the quarter packaging shipments failed by twelve percent per primarily as a result of the temporary shutdown in march of our <unk> plant in france due to covid nineteen shipments to the north american can cheat market increased slightly year over year automotive ship declined fifty four percent compared to last year as many of our automotive oem customers curtailed production for april and most of may price and mix was a headwind of two million euros costs were a tailwind of twenty one million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with labor and maintenance as important contributors metal costs were neutral in the quarter as we face difficult year for your comps ubc supply chain challenges and lower metal prices fx translation was a tailwind of one million euros now turn to slide ten and let's focus on the a and t segment adjusted ebitda of thirty one million euros decreased by fifty one percent compared to last year volume was a headwind of forty six million euros on lower aerospace and t i d aerospace shipments fell thirty seven percent compared to last year as aerospace oem and distributors began to reduce orders t id shipments declined by twenty percent due to lower industrial activity in both europe and the us price and mix was a three million euro headwind due to lower aerospace shipments cons were a tailwind of fifteen million euros due to strong broad-based cost control with labor metal and maintenance as important contributors lastly fx translation was a one million euro tail in in the quarter now turn to slide eleven and let's focus on the as and i segment adjusted <unk> of negative one million euros decreased by thirty one million euros compared to the second quarter of twenty nineteen volume was a thirty one million year old headwind automotive shipments declined fifty two percent compared to last year due to customer shutdowns for a significant portion of the quarter industry shipments declined sixteen percent due to lower industrial activity in europe price and mix was a nine million euro headwind partially due to price and mix as a consequence of weaker market conditions costs were a nine mill in europe telling on strong cost control with with labor energy and fixed cost has important contributors lastly ethics translation was a one million year old headwind in the quarter now turning to slide twelve i want to highlight our very strong cost performance during the second quarter in the second quarter we manage to flex our cost by eighty three percent cost flex represents the change of cost over the change of revenues for the second quarter of twenty twenty compared to the second quarter of twenty nineteen effectively for every dollar change in revenue we were able to flex our cost by eighty three this compares favorably to the seventy five percent variable cost estimate we provided last quarter at the bottom of the page you can see that each of our businesses demonstrated strong cost control with park at ninety two percent cost flex and a and t and s and i at seventy five percent to put this in context excluding metal and appreciation we reduced costs by approximately one hundred in europe compared to the second quarter of last year these cost savings were driven by strong cost control across the businesses including labor maintenance professional fees subcontractors and energy i will note that our second quarter twenty twenty figures include approximately a fifteen million euro benefit from european state employment aid related to covid nineteen i want to congratulate the team for the aggressive actions taken on cost we will continue to maintain our strong focus on cost control particularly given the uncertain demand environment now let's turn to slide thirteen and discuss our balance sheet and liquidity position at the end of the second quarter our leverage was four point four times and our net debt was two point two billion euros slightly lower than our net debt position at the end of twenty nineteen we remain very committed to capital discipline we reduced our twenty twenty capex target to approximately a hundred seventy five million euros a ninety six million reduction euro reduction from twenty nineteen through the first half of twenty twenty we set thirty two million euros less in capex than in the same period of last year our free cash flow for the second quarter was negative thirty three million euros during the quarter as a consequence of lower activity our factored receivables were lower than the levels that we have maintained in recent quarters and negatively impacted our free cash flow by seventy three million euros we would the reverse to occur as activity levels increase excluding the impact of factoring the company actually generated positive free cash flow in the second quarter which is a very impressive outcome in my view our free cash flow for the first half of twenty twenty was fifty four million euros as john mark noted earlier we expect to generate positive free cash flow in twenty twenty based on our current view of market condition generating free cash flow is a firm priority and we remain committed to the leveraging as you can see in our debt summary on the bottom left hand side of the page we have no bond maturities until twenty twenty four during the quarter we refinance the remaining two hundred million of our four and five eight percent notes due twenty twenty one with three with three hundred twenty five million of five and five eight percent notes due twenty twenty eight twenty twenty eight while we initially plan to repay the twenty ones with free cash flow we felt it was prudent to remove this near term maturity given the favorable debt market conditions notably this was the lowest a coupon dollar bomb a concealion has ever priced a considerable achievement in the midst of the pandemic as a result of our financing activities thus far in twenty twenty we now expect cat interest of a hundred fifty to a hundred sixty million euros our cash plus amounts available under our committed facilities was nine hundred forty nine million euros at the end of the second quarter as john mark noted we added fifty million euros to this balance in july and we remain very comfortable in our liquidity position i will now hand the call back to <unk> thank you peter uh let's start to say fifteen i want to highlight so think that is core to our business sustainability in early july we published our twenty nineteen business and sustainability report which you can find on our website i'd like to point out a few highlights from twenty nineteen safety is our first priority our target is to reduce our recordable case rates by ten percent year after year between twenty sixteen and twenty nineteen a recordable case rate decreased by twenty seven percent and we are trending very well this year this means that more of our colleagues are returning home injury free every day we also improved our energy efficiency by six point four percent compared to a twenty fifteen baseline that is the equivalent of a hundred thousand metric terms of co2 savings every year further we introduce a twenty twenty five target reduce greenhouse gas emission intensity by twenty five percent against the twenty fifteen baseline and we have a detailed plan to achieve this target as many of you know recycling is a core comp competency at constellium aluminum is infinitely recyclable with seventy five percent of all aluminum ever produced still in use today muscle should is one of the largest recyclers of aluminum cans globally with the capacity to recycle over twenty billion cans every year at <unk> we also recycled the equivalent of twelve billion beverage cans every year as a company consolion recycled of a five hundred and c two thousand metric terms of externally sourced aluminum scrap in twenty nineteen i am also proud that third parties are recognizing constillion for our sustainability achievements the aluminum stewardship initiative or asi is an industry led initiative to drive sustainability across the entire aluminum value chain from producers to customers in twenty nineteen we received asi certifications for zingens casting and rolling operations and we began producing a site certified cause for our customers from zingen in twenty twenty we also received a site certification of our <unk> facility under a provisional covid conditions in twenty twenty we achieved the ecovadis platinum rating which is the world to the top one percent of companies assessed worldwide and we received an esg rate think of double a from msci placing us in the top five percent of our sector overall we had a very successful year on our sustainability objectives in twenty nineteen and i look forward to continuing our progress and these very important initiatives now let's turn to slide sixteen and discuss our end markets we believe our balanced portfolio of products across end markets geography and customers is a competitive advantage during challenging times like deals i'll start with the packaging market packaging is a core market for consumer and represented thirty eight percent of our ltm revenue we continue to see strong demand in north america and stable demand in europe further evidence that this market is both recession resilient and secular growth we believe the packaging market as long term secular growth take are winds driven by customer preference for aluminum cans our customers continue to invest in new can lines with several additional investments in north america just announced in the last week these additional lines should driving incremental demand for can sheet in the years to come the consumer preference trend is only one of tailwinds for can sheet in europe the demand for can sheet continues to grow the based on substitution of aluminum for fuel in the us we continue to expect the growth of autobody sheet demand to tighten supply to the packaging market over the medium to long term now let's move to automotive over the long term automotive remains a secular growth market for aluminum customers continue to prefer larger vehicles with regulations aimed at increasing fuel efficiency in reducing emissions the automotive market will need to continue to lightweight in addition we expect hybrid and electric vehicles to continue to gain share of the feet these vehicles are aluminum intensive due to the import terms of flights waiting to achieve their range objectives the consum is well positioned to realize the benefits of the secular shift to aluminum in automotive and the electrification of the feed moving to more recent trends automotive oems began cultivating production in march and largely resume production in may while demand from our customers increased significantly in june we have experienced even demand for our product as a result of supply chain challenges and covid nineteen hotspots why we're optimistic about automotive demand in the back half of twenty twenty the demand for our products will be dependent on the level of production at the oem let's turn now to aerospace aerospace represented fifteen percent of our ltm revenues the near term outlook for aerospace remains uncertain due to the effects from covid nineteen and the seven thirty seven max aerospace oems have reduced build rates and it is unclear how long build rates will remain at these levels we expect aerospace shipments in the third and fourth quarter of twenty twenty will be lower than the level in the second quarter of twenty twenty in t i d we expect to continue to expand in each product in a diversified range of markets over the long term in the near term the defense and rail markets remain strong but most industrial and transportation markets remain weak these markets are dependent upon the health of the industrial economy in europe and north america it is only a when a to what extent these markets will rebound in closing i again want to thank the constituent team for their tireless efforts during this strong time we remain committed to operational execution harvest seeing the benefits of our investments discipline capital deployment debt reduction and shareholder value creation with that joanna we will now open the q a session thank you sir please gentlemen if you have a question at this time please press star then the number one on your touch tone telephone if your question has been answered or you wish yourself to remove yourself from the queue please press the your first question comes from the line of chris terry from deutsche bank your line is open chris if you are on mute please unmute please your line is open okay how's your mark computer can you hear me yes we can cause morning crews okay you're fine good morning um thanks for taking my question um the first thing i wanted to start with was just the utilization rates and the comments from one q you sort of step through how you saw utilization in each of the divisions for two q and then perhaps for three q and four q appreciate you don't have guidance but i will whether you could maybe conceptually talk through um three q versus four q and just versus two q or any comments you could make on the divisions as an update from last quarter thanks sure chris so i'll start to the markets and and kind of translated into what it can mean for the divisions right for the business unit so when you look at our second quarter of this year this is the second quarter of last year right you see packaging roughly ten for send down you see a automotive fifty percent down you see aerospace forty percent down right roughly and the other markets in each markets about twenty five percent down this is made a very different dynamics right so packaging what we are seeing now is ninety five percent utilization there was a bit of a drop uh especially in april with all the lockdowns in europe uh reduced reduction in a can consumption and all that but that has come act pretty strong and the us continues to be quite strong so we look at you know packaging again recession resilient secular growth and we're pretty confident for the second half of the year and we look at the q2 as being uh kind of a normal quarter because of all that happened uh in april and a little bit in that if i look at automotives uh it has re-snap back i mean i think when we talked on q1 we're talking of twenty percent utilization as we was and now we're at about eighty percent right and if you do the average of twenty and eighty you get two fifty which is about what we experienced in the second half in terms of reduction in the shipments it is um you know it seems like it can be stronger than eighty percent uh going forward we still are running very well in july but we've seen uh that this restart has been with all kinds of fits and stuff right so you've got upspots you've got supply chain disruptions you've got uh uh difficulties in bringing products from mexico uh building uh trucks in texas is challenging so you've got all those uh you know operational issues that all of us in the supply chain have to deal with uh but clearly the demand seems to be you know well in excess of uh eighty percent of where we were last year so that that's encouraging and hopefully uh you know covid nineteen doesn't uh throw too much of a wrench in and that's a good thread if i look now at aerospace where we were running at around sixty percent in the quarter uh we expect more pain in the second half of the year and i think the the reason for that is it's a long supply chain um and the customers uh you know move uh a little bit more slowly in terms of uh adjusting their orders uh and that that is creating a bit of a of a lag in terms of uh how much pain we take we are in very detailed discussions with our customers in a very collaborative fashion to look at what the second half of to look like and wise contractually we could fall some volumes on us that's not our type what they don't we don't want to force them so what we're uh working through is uh taking more pain now in the second app so that twenty twenty one we start with a clean slate so we would expect some reduction in operating rates in aerospace in the second half of the year so if you translate all that into what it means for the different views i would expect bob packaging and automotive to be better i would expect s and i or motive uh structures essentially to be better in the second half and we would expect the nt to be a more challenge in the second half okay thanks thanks so much and so oh go ahead i i just sort of follow up on packaging specifically um where the volumes are down at you know around about ten percent i think year on year and you're saying muscle shelves is doing well it seems of the us is going going well i think crown yesterday mentioned that southern europe was weak can you just come in a little bit further about packaging in the eu region is it was it down in the quarter because of demand or because you had for utilities offline and maybe you could quantify some of the eu impacts yeah i think so the reason i'm saying more than ninety percent or ninety five percent whatever that's a hundred percent is exactly because of some weakness in europe right and i think it's got to do with uh uh both uh you know the the reduction in uh activity in south in europe i mean a lot of these countries have uh economies that are based on tourism and you know this is not the best here for tourism as we will know uh and uh we are seeing you know there's little clusters and hotspots so everybody's a bit you know vigilant as it should be right so that is weighing down a little bit on uh can consumption in europe yes okay and and just sorry i'd want to follow up on on uh on on working capital specifically i just want to maybe peter if you could talk through the you know the two key moving parts obviously you've stepped through those waterfall charts and you're getting cost out doing a great job on the cost side i just wanted if you're coming a little bit further on the second half of the year um and what the opportunities are that on working capital uh in terms of uh you're saying positive for the full year you've already obviously hit the positive number at the halfway point so just just wanted if you could talk through the moving parts and working capital sure happy to do it and just for context so on the second quarter as we said last uh quarter we would uh use working capital and we in fact burn sixty three million of working capital in the um nq two and and for the first half were positive twenty four so based on where we sit today i think it's uh plausible to think that you know with auto ramping with packaging uh kind of continuing to ramp back up uh that we could lose some ground in the in the back half of the year so uh not a huge negative but we could see working capital being a use in the back half of the year um but chris i would say that uh we remain confident in spite of our that we uh we can achieve a free cash flow position thanks thanks beta that's uh good too for me thank you okay good your next one question comes from the line of josh sullivan from the benchmark company your line is open good morning morning josh yeah just a question how are you thinking you know of any tariffs on canadian alumni you know have you increased any inventory expecting that or just what should we be thinking on that front if that if that comes to fruition yeah well i mean we believe it's a misguided uh measure if it happens right we we'd love to get interested in the past we've got it removed it may come back um we think it's misguided and it doesn't address a problem which is over capacity from china from an unmarked economy that doesn't play by the same rules as we do now that said if it had things it's got a very limited impact on us i'll remind you that uh we pass through the mel uh cost essentially to uh most of our customers there may be a little uh section of the business where we and it's reprised immediately when it happens uh but on the other side we may gain a little bit more on scrap recycling as well so not much of an impact for us uh the reason we're against it is much more a matter of principles because we believe in free in sales trades and really a problem for our uh finances or our you're gonna make a outcome got it and then just on on the can sheet front you know can you remind us of you know when the you know your your larger contracts are up for renegotiation and then just any comment around you know pricing strength yeah so we see um so we don't go into the detail of exactly which contracts with you when uh but uh you know that we've got to a few renewals coming in uh around the uh twenty two horizon uh we are making good progress uh and i think the pricing environment is uh i would describe it as a mildly positive in the us and my lead negative in europe because of the specific situation now i remind you that contractual negotiations take a lot of time here and uh once we you know i say it's might be positive there it might be negative there between and whenever we actually think a contract things may change uh but i think it's a pretty benign environment and our product is in demand uh i'll brag a little bit our quality and i'll say of this he's very much recognized <unk> has done a terrific job in uh over the past five years uh and he's a very strong player in the market now very recognized quite a service-wise <unk> has always been a so we have a strong positions and i'm looking at the future with a great deal of confidence great thank you thanks so much thanks josh your next question comes from the line of these exactly <unk> from the <unk> markets your line is open great thanks for taking my questions um first of all i did have one question on the numbers for the second quarter did you say there was a fifteen million one time benefit included in the eighty one million dollar adjusted ebitda line you're talking about for the uh for the labor benefits i thought it was a covid nineteen state eight benefits that didn't include it in eighty one million yeah coded in adjusted ebitda thirty and it's not a one off and it continues those programs are what is referred to as a <unk> <unk> or short time work and these government programs continue through twenty twenty and in some cases in two twenty twenty one okay so when you say assume about a fifteen million dollar quarterly benefit from those programs each course well no yeah no because what'll happen david is remember so in the second quarter we had a lot of people on the sidelines right but as we ramp up then we're going to have substantially less of that so i think you should assume that uh in the businesses that you know it's gonna so packaging for example where we had some benefit in in q2 we should have you know basically very limited if if any benefit in in q3 and uh you know automotive which should fade away and and aerospace will have some continuing given the operating innovation right there but it'll be a much lower number to to give you that indication we may sure about people being uh you know an employee during the quarter at the trough which is behind us uh we had six thousand people and there was some kind of unemployment benefit or you know temporary layoff now we are at less than two thousand so it's closed dramatically yeah and and david just to put it in perspective the uh you know if you get to the fourth quarter the number might be something like twenty five percent of that right to space on the utilization rate just rough number okay that's actually helpful thank you and then just in terms of the um you know the the the individual uh and market commentary on the aerospace side obviously that's the the or has been you know the highest margin business um and and you know just in terms of the outlet commentary you framed obviously uh two segments up one segment down but you know the down segment is again the highest margin segment i didn't really get a sense as to order of magnitude of the down number versus the up numbers and can you just give us a sense as to you know you you believe that aerospace will completely offset the recovery and auto and packaging um in the second half or or a bit or you know color on order of magnitude on the on the decline in aerospace would be helpful yeah so it's very difficult to tell uh dated because we're as we speak in uh very active discussions with our customers and at the end of the date so call that we have to make jointly with them as i mentioned we've got contracts whereby we can force them to take some products uh which they will take and pay for all but then they don't need it the following year right so they hold the they hold the inventory they're holding the back so we are looking collaboratively with them in terms of what is it exactly they need which by the way i don't think they fully know now and it's no criticism of them i mean it's very unusual time and once we know what they need and we look at what goods do we take then i could answer your question possibly at this stage i cannot i would just say that there will be for sure more pain in uh in uh auto structures and then the you know those structures in there my apologies aerospace now the other thing too is this is compounded by the fact that if you look at any period in the recent past the second half is always weaker than the first half right in aerospace so that that's something to factor in as well okay and just my last related question is um i think you mentioned i think average utilization rates for aerospace related um demand in the in the second quarter was around sixty percent correct at your facilities is that right what is that number now uh we're running still around that number but i would expect it to uh go down maybe to fifty percent that kind of range okay all right that's helpful thanks very much okay yeah so it's it's important to say we're not expecting it to go down to thirty percent right that's that's that's okay that's on the arrive speaker is your next question comes from the line of <unk> woodworth from creditries your line is open yeah i good morning thanks for uh peter first question on the a hundred million euro cost reductions how much of that would you view as structural and then you know i guess just in general in terms of the amount of cost you think you could take out of the business this year on a permanent basis can you give us an update on on those efforts um so if we look if we look at the uh i mean so the biggest piece as i a hundred million uh is related to labor right so uh and that's probably labor is probably you know half of that a hundred million so uh what we are doing now is we are real mostly looking at the business and you know what it's likely to be like for the next couple of years and then you know trying to size our labor forces according to that so uh in that regard i think we would expect that there's going to be some uh kind of permanent savings but remember as we uh kind of ramp up the operations uh we do expect some of that cost is gonna come back right so um you know i would say it's hard to give a a really precise number on that court it's a it's a difficult one yeah okay um the courage if i may add we have talked about rising twenty two right and and one of the strategic initiatives was to look at how do we lean our organization without losing competencies capabilities but how do we lean and make the organization stronger and i think what covid nineteen is doing to us and i guess too many other companies are there is accelerate a number of initiatives that may have taken more time to be implemented so along the lines that peter was saying i think we'll come out of this is some permanent cost reductions and as we ramp up we will not ramp up and inject back a hundred million of cost uh how much you know we will remain to be seen because we are really uh learning as we are doing and we are just in the middle of it now out but uh we will definitely emerge out of that leaner and stronger and there's certain categories like for example professional fees subcontractors where you know kind of as we work without these cause those are you know kind of big categories of reduction i think we uh were able to uh to kind of live without a lot of that going forward so so yeah i think there's there's there's definitely a a piece of that that we can carry forward and then there's just sure example that are not triggered they're quite revealing right so we've got a very strong um you know r and d and technical support organization which is you know people that are centrally located and go and uh health plans and uh historically lot of the work was done by people going to the location now obviously in the past three months nobody's been able to travel anywhere and a lot of that has been done through a remote interaction video conference but even when you go to uh to a plant and you look at i got a problem and i need to uh improve uh the speed on this mill we've had people you know interacting by the milk a bit on a facetime and uh going into the looking into the the role uh the um the rolling meals uh by facetime with a uh technical advisor on the other side of the planet and that works actually fine which we wouldn't have thought it would be possible so in a few sure what you're gaining here is well you're saving travel time which is not very good for the aerospace business but also you are saying you're saying the cost you're saying the time which means that people can be on several interventions was historically within a week you know it takes a week to get to the plant where you get the job done so i think we're we're going to discover a few new ways of doing business in our space that are going to be quite interesting in the future and i think it's gonna help us inject more brain and talent uh remotely with more uh impact yeah and kurt you know as we go forward we'll uh we may be able to give you more color on this but you know whole fully it comes across that we're really looking hard at taking structural costs out and in the short term uh the objective is we wanna be you know kind of free cash flow positive through this crisis um and so that we don't take on any incremental debt ideally and in the longer term we wanna emerge with a you know kind of much stronger earnings power so we're focused on exactly that and and uh you know we'll have more to say as we progress okay now that that's helpful and then you know in terms of the the pre-cash flow um you know dynamics you mentioned i think a seventy three million impact from uh factoring this quarter or otherwise you'd be pre-cash a positive which is pretty you pretty positive given your utilization rate and now you're talking about ninety five percent utilization and packaging over eighty percent and auto and it seems like auto should move higher once supply chains get more normalized so i you know seventy five percent of your business is could be close to ninety percent utilization in a couple months i get that arrow is weaker um but it would seem like from a free cashflow generation standpoint um you know unless working capital would be a major negative you you you should be generating decent free cash and the back half of the year can you can you comment at all on free cash flow potential in the back half of the year yeah sure thanks for the question so we won't put a specific number uh we're confident that we will generate free cash flow um for the full year um and you know the back half of the year i think there's a there's a very good chance that we can you know generate some free cash flow but it depends a lot on what happens with trade working capital as i said we've got you know the ramp of these businesses so we wanna be a little cautious until we see the pace of the ramp um and the consequences of the ramp um but again for the full year we we remain confident that we can generate free cash flow okay and then just find a question on on arrow john mark you had a comment on i guess working with the oem to create you said a clean slate entering twenty two twenty one so you know is that um statement kind of reflecting the fact that the oems cut very quickly and i assume there's sort of an excess inventory issue that they're dealing with or in general in the supply chain and so you know um hypothetically your your volumes would be below the actual build rate to help them clear inventory so then when you get into twenty twenty one you know the supply chain is in a pretty good position and you know contractually you said you're not gonna force it on them but then you you know if you're gonna help them manage that do they do you get anything in return i e you know price benefit or you know there's this kind of everyone helping each other just a little bit understanding of kind of what you meant by the clean slate comp well yeah no fair questions so um i think i've commented in the past on the fact that i thought that the shipments were making into the uh to the oem right into the supply chain were actually higher than what the build rates were warranting at the time and obviously the build rates are going down very significantly down so now so the the pain we're gonna take in the second half i think is not going to to all the uh you know uh inventory build up in the supply chain first of all uh but i think what that does is it positions us for twenty twenty one that doesn't show further material ratio that's what we're we're into right and we want to be in a place where what we supply by and large consistent with what is being built right so that that's what we're trying to do whether we get there fully i don't know but certainly we are aiming to be better in twenty one than what the second the nine months of uh you know post covid uh will be in a np that's that's one of the goals um in terms of what we're getting from uh you oems uh we've got very strong deep strategic relationships with them uh i've commented also the best of the fact that we are in it for the long haul and i think it's uh evidence by the tenure contract which along with this i mean uh ten years a long duration never happened before and uh we did it uh because it was the right thing to do for both uh companies for both businesses and we didn't do it as a reaction to covid water right i mean that was really the desire to send the strategic alignment between the two companies so we are looking past the current crisis the current crisis we've gotta get all in the same boat or in the same aircraft and put us in the same place work together to overcome the crisis and we are not talking about you know if i do that you give me a bit more price or whatever i think it's just a relationship where we want to be in the win-win pattern and we do some things that help them and they'll do some things that help us in the future which have already done in the past and that's already that's already happened and that's continuing okay great thank you very much cool your next question comes from the line of matthew fields from bank of america your line is open uh he's on mark he he peter um one on the on the markets and then one on the balance sheet please um so you know saw that can volumes were down about eleven percent but um you know north uh reported can volumes up eleven percent i think you guys face relatively the same markets in europe can you can you sort of point to what maybe they're having more success on their can volumes was it was it enough for stock being down issue or or a market issue or what like what can you just explain that discrepancy for us please sure explainly i believe i mean i kind of comment on there uh specific uh situation but in in our case the main reason was that we have to take down netflix for a full week and then ramp it up gradually i remind you that netflix was at the center of a hotspot of the first uh real of slot in france uh and that was a very uh very terrible conditions for uh you know second half of march so in march we continue to ship out of finished goods but then we had to replenish the uh the the finished goods and that's really took down our uh you know our shipments in the second quarter but we're back to normal now okay thanks that's uh that's sort of what i expected um and on the balance sheet it looks like you got um a decent amount of funding from from france and um and obviously switzerland and and germany um you said it was partially guaranteed but it's also secured can you just give us a um a a a better understanding of sort of what it secured is it inventory or is it sort of p p e and then to what extent is it guaranteed by the french governments well it it depends on the facility but the big one the french one is secured on on uh uh p p e um and uh in the case of the german ones one of them is secured and one of them is unsecured and the swiss one is unsecured um and uh the guarantees what the way they work is they guarantee a certain percent of the principle so uh it's a normal syndicate of banks with uh in the case of france i think the guarantee is for seventy percent of the uh or sorry eighty percent of the in the case of france of the um of the principal balances guaranteed by the by the french state in the case of germany i think it's eighty percent too so just just for our purposes as credit analyst eighty percent of that french loan is sort of non-recourse to you okay well again it's uh it is it is recourse to us uh what i think the point is is that if you're a lender so for example if you're in the syndicate of banks and you uh are lending say fifty percent your responsibility is for ten oh sorry fifty percent fifty million your responsibility is for ten of that right so the it's the banks that benefit from the guarantee not the company okay so you still have to deliver on the commitments to the banks yeah absolutely absolutely okay but one type of yeah i'm sorry the government is in fact stopping the loan for you it takes something to loan for the banks exactly exactly but one thing to you know kind of i think is a really important point is you know our our intent in putting this liquidity on the balance sheet was to remove any question about the fact that we had enough liquidity as we said from the beginning and based on the performance in the second quarter we do not anticipate using this so the french facility we had to raw just by the terms of the agreement but it just sits on our balance sheet as cash and uh the german facility that we've now signed up in july you know we don't expect to draw that uh the dd uh the delay draw term loan we haven't draw that uh and the swiss facility uh we don't have that drawn in in most instances so and the way we benefit from the state guarantee is who uh very cheap interest rate yeah that's right right so that's right cheap money and that that was important to us we don't think we need the money so we're not gonna pay a lot of interest for it yeah exactly that and it obviously was an inducment for the banks to lend right now fair enough and that's uh i you know i think you the french facilities what two and a half percent effectively at this point yeah yeah that's the code all right so you don't really have an incentive to pay that off quickly you know given your bonds or kind of twice right uh that no no that's right no remember the the uh the use of the there are some limitations on the use of the capital right so for example we can't use that capital to go and uh buy back bonds in the market so it's really meant to be for uh you know kind of operating needs of a company but yeah you're right we don't have a we don't have a strong incentive to to repay that but what we will what we will do is know obviously there's some cost to it right so as we kind of emerge from the crisis and have a little more visibility than we'll unwind those facilities okay that's uh that's very helpful thanks for all the color and good luck in the back thank you thank you your next question comes from the line of shawn wandrak from <unk> your line is open hey guys thanks for taking my questions and a really great job on transparent seeing costs here uh both very helpful thanks um just when you think about big picture if you look at the auto market um there are sort of projections out in the market that we'll have about you know twenty five percent uh decline in new cars is here you know mostly based on the fact that we weren't producing back in march april um and if you look at the used auto market you know it's been pretty strongly with used prices really uh you know rising even above last year um you know you talked about of how productions been increasing and demand is increasing there um you know to kind of get to down twenty five percent you know you'd have to have some pretty strong growth in three q and three four so i guess what i'm asking is do you see that market as potentially inflecting soon um you know with the man pulling through based on on a lack of cars and if you can provide a little color what you're seeing there that'd be very helpful yeah so um then the older book is strong there's no question it's above the eighty percent that i'm mentioning right uh but we've been a little bit caught uh you know by customers uh just a few months ago telling us uh we need product tomorrow and then telling as the next day the plant is shut down right so you know we are very vigilant right so i hope i i think the end demand is there i think that's true in the us that's true in europe right the governments have injected a lot of money in the hands of consumers right through the uh part the unemployment benefits of you know different shapes and forms and you see on both continents and that is you know pretty good for uh and demand at the end of the day so i hope it's gonna be uh it's gonna materialize into uh the older book we have is going to be actually real olders and shipments in which case it should be better uh but you know i've uh we we've we've we've seen fits and starts you see uh plants restarting and then uh shutting down because uh there's a covid infections or you see people having trouble uh staffing you know the full shift because there's uh uh too many cases in the in the huds so it's still fragile i mean it looks quite good but it's still fragile right that's helpful thank you john morgan i guess that's a good lead into the next question so when when you think about your customers um you know we've had some shutdowns um we've had things come back online do you do you feel that your customers and their ceos are getting more confidence in their ability to stay online or getting better in terms of protocols and sort of advancing up the curb there yeah i i would think so i think all of this have made uh tremendous uh efforts to uh provide the proper environment for uh for our uh employees uh it was very interesting i was commenting on the the you know half percent of our employees have been affected by covid uh confirmed um we have had no new case confirm in case in europe since the middle of may so i think this is saying something about the fact that when people take responsibility uh in their daily lives right because it goes beyond what they do within our factories or during the eight hours or ten hours whatever they work with us uh you can have an impact and i think you know if people wear masks when they interact with uh outside uh which people uh uh they they come across i think it makes a tremendous difference uh so i hope the reality will slowly or more than slowly uh settle in and uh and good practices will uh get that uh virus away from us sooner rather than later and i think people are seeing the confidence building up i mean human nature you need to be affected to take steps and i think we're in the process where in many places people are still being affected they take the steps but if you look at china and china's you know going extremely strong uh you know it's a small operation for us but we are both budgeted both last year right uh you look at europe no new cases are really the uh on the downward trend even though there's some clusters here and there and we'll see a stronger uh recall rebound and i hope this is coming uh to us in the us through the us that's great i good to hear john mark and i hope everybody's safe and well over there thank you very much um and good luck thank you well let's be great i go ahead sir oh go ahead joanna um you i am sharing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to mr john <unk> ceo of <unk> go ahead thank you joanna so thank you every thanks everyone uh for participating in the call today as you can see we are very is focused on uh uh facing the crisis protecting uh cash flow and
