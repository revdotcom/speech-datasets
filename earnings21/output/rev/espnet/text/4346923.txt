handing what we had not experienced in help in production the liquidity i mentioned includes cash preservation and the construction of an operational world built with a zero-based budget methodology for the rest of twenty twenty to improve cash position i guess these boards that are on one hundred and sixty million dollars in short terms trade lines and constantly digital payments related decisions from slope to operate engines to have a more efficient use of liquidity as a result of this may just because you read cash positions of the companies to that other approach you made with six hundred fifteen million places as of april the thirtieth an amount significantly higher than the amount we held at the start of the year our mutual-based budget captures efficiencies that amount between seventy five to ninety million dollars on twenty twenty of which eighty four percent will be obtained from fixed cost and sixteen percent from a on top of that the company has decided to reduce forty million dollars in capex from the quality and projects that are not necessarily to operate under the existing market conditions the initiatives related to operations excellent aim and ensuring the optimum with sofas it's regarded services manpower and logistics to be deployed according to the evolution of demand in our different markets in this context we expect a four the migration to our technological inclusive the future such as saudis one that enables our clients book contractors and mental remix dispatches through a digital platform during march august one accounted for sale thirty percent forty one percent and twenty three percent of this event dispatches of columbia the us and panama respectively and for forty nine percent three percent and thirty three percent of the units dispatches in this countries in relation to the investors announced to the market on our last earning call for four hundred million we would like to mention that after careful analysis the transaction had been postponed based on the uncertainties surrounding the short term impact of covid nineteen on the worldwide economy but maintaining our commitment to cover them out as soon as the market returns to better conditions we are aware of the impact that this decision has on leverage versions of the company and in that sense we have been in constant discussions with both our rating agency our lenders to make sure that they stay will understand and support our decisions when the strong cash position of the company is saving initiatives within reject the support from our stakeholders and deposit commitment of our more than ten thousand employees to we firmly believe that argos is fully prepared to face the current market conditions to continue building dreams that promote development and transform lives now moving to our consolidated results i would like to start by mentioning that all comparison in this call will be made on the results including efrs sixteen as we now have comparable figures for the present year percent it has changes in <unk> dispatches in america are calculated based on the performance numbers of twenty nineteen which include the operations from the <unk> divestors carried out in the us region during twenty nineteen as well as the land the praise of registered in columbia last year sam and dispatches reach three point six million tons during the first quarter of twenty twenty decreasing six point one percent when compared to is in quarter of twenty nine team and remix dispatches reach two point one million community meters posting a ten points represent decrease on a like footlike basis these results were affected mainly by the lockdown measures in columbia and some constant of the koreans into america and to a lesser extent to their verse weather condition experience in some regions of the us <unk> closed in two point two trillion passes with an piece of <unk> point two percent on my year to year basis but even mainly the evaluation of the colonial pace the every down the road hand it is one percent on a like for like basis in line with the planning volumes experience in both segments during the quarter as a result of the showdown operation in columbia and most of our markets in central america and the caribbean now to start with our results in each region i would like to invite bill to explain the performance of the business in the us and our view for the market thank you juan and good morning everyone i would like to start by providing some color on our volume performance cement dispatches posted a slight decrease of one point two percent for the quarter with low single digit growth in our deep south and florida cement districts of around three percent and one percent respectively the northeast reflected positive dynamics too but started to face some deterioration and volumes during march due to the health crisis situation mainly in our mid east markets for the red and big business we experienced a five point five percent decrease on a like for like basis when excluding the volume from the plants divested in december two thousand and nineteen this decrease is mainly due to adverse weather conditions in major markets during the quarter where when compared to the first quarter of two thousand nineteen georgia dallas and houston experience thirteen ten and seven less operational days respectively on prices based on healthy market dynamics during the first few months of the year we achieved an improvement in our the next segment of one point eight percent when compared to the same quarter of two thousand nineteen cement prices on the other hand stayed on similar levels to the ones observed in the same quarter of last year these results are aligned with our strategy to continue improving in terms of profitability always monitoring market conditions which is going to be key during the rest of the year due to the current challenging circumstances for the construction industry and the economy as a hole eva does on a life for life basis decreased by six point one percent affected in part by lower readiness volumes but mostly by higher maintenance expenses of eight point one million dollars for martinsburg and new very high in terms of the market i'd like to highlight the resilience of the us demand during the first quarter of the year despite the quarter of nineteen outbreaks presented throughout the country even though construction has remained in a sent activity in the near future we envision a slowdown of the residential and commercial segments based on week readings of some indicators such as unemployment housing starts housing permits and the architectural billings index on the on others on the civil and infrastructure front we perceive a short term impact due to financial constraints at a state and local governments level which based on construction spending readings since mid two thousand team we're supporting the positive dynamic team for this segment until february twenty twenty on the midterm though we expect a rebound based on potential stimulus measures from the government related to infrastructure which would positive easily impact the construction sector due to its influence on employment and the multiplier effect on the economy as a whole thank you will to compute on the us reason i would like twenty <unk> the fact that we are confident about the role that infrastructure will play on the record of the right economy and in that sense we expect the government initiatives to be developed around that sector moving onto columbia i want to highlight the price improve went and achieved during the first quarter of the year together with the efficiencies in the genetic captures since the second half of last year which led upon increasingly the margin even in a scenario of lower volumes as a result of a current team tom will now provide additional color on this region thank you one and good morning during the quarter we completed lamenting a strategy to recover value which led to an increasing prices of nearly thirteen point five percent versus the same quarter of last year with a temporary loss of volume volumes were also affected by the quarantine between in columbia from march twenty fifth on which costs a reduction equivalent to eight percent of the business working days in the first quarter through the quarantine we were able to continue these parts to some essential infrastructure projects that as soon as <unk> and a few mining projects as well there are some experts from our <unk> demands somebody makes a spot to decrease thirteen point nine percent and nineteen point five percent just that people on a real basis in line with the pricing movement are reading that point to that fifteen percent growth during the quarter resulting also from lower maintenance expenses as well as from our continuous efforts to negotiate supply contracts from team materials such as skull which led to a decrease in the an organic of eight point eight percent versus the same period of twenty nineteen i would also like to emphasize on the easy marketing improvement of four point three percent which is an important achievement in the scenario of law was volumes in relation to the starting of our operation to the date of this call we have we started our meals at <unk> <unk> the lu and <unk> as well as seventeen of our <unk> plants at credit country we will adjust our operations network as required by the growth of demand always focused on implementing all the safety products to ensure the health of our employees contractors clients and suppliers on the demand side we expect for very improvement on the industrial segment during the month of may as construction projects we'll be able to fully start the operations and hardware stores will become available in line with demand for construction materials our clients from the industrial segments have been able to review the quarantine measures by implementing as three controls on their carts and therefore are ready to prescribe their products to the dates of this report important products such as student projects a physical one two and three and <unk> and so wanting to have already successfully with study their cement and ready makes consumption in terms of competition during the first quarter the market experience that decreased in clinical instrument inputs of for five and fifty six percent respectively when compared to the first quarter of last year originally between march and april the info party price has increased seventeen percent due to the evaluation of the colombian pencil would at more space for continuing our value recovery strategy when the market goes back to more normal families thank you tom i would also like to highlight their reactions taken by the columbian government in preventing the increasing the contain june court within the country which were a frame our belief of a prompt recovery on the local economy moving onto the caribbean in central america i would like to highlight the improvements that we saw with the margin when comp went to the last quarter of last year despite the fact that our two biggest operations fundamental honduras were closed student the last week of the quarter due to the criminal crisis <unk> we provide more information on the performance oh good reason thank you one and good morning everyone the first quarter of twenty twenty was positive in terms of market dynamics for the country like <unk> and dominican republic during january february and mid march from the second week of my we have several patients in demand in both countries due to the lockdowns declared by local governments these lockdowns have been partially lifted to the date of this call on april we have valuing on data and dominican republic of around forty percent of a regular month panama continued to have challenging market dynamics during the first two months of the year that worsened on march with covid impact on the demand and the later quarantine measures implemented by the government we the lockdown measure for the construction sector to be lifted before mid may in accordance with public statements made by the government and in that sense a reopening from our facility around that state katie on the other side continued these projects is trend improving prices in seven point one percent and volumes in eleven point one percent versus the first quarter of twenty nineteen overall we experienced increases in both the everyday and the everyday margin when compared to the fourth quarter of twenty of five point nine percent and one point two percent respectively unfortunately these results were still lower than the first quarter of twenty nineteen in part due to the quarantine measures but mostly due to the overall market conditions in panama and the fact that prices in goods continue to be lowered than the average price of twenty nineteen as a result cement volumes decreased four point one percent and ready mixed volumes decreased thirty four point one percent when pair to the first quarter of twenty nineteen this lower values led to a decrease of sixteen point nine percent in the revenues and thirty three point five percent on <unk> during this quarter we continue to work on obtaining further efficiencies on in the genetics on our local operations include us for instance we integrated a solid fuel storage in the north of the country that will allow us to receive bigger amounts of fuel and therefore improve the purchase price we also supply during the first four over the year eleven point six percent of the energy from our together as a solar plant with the solar farm operated by celsium with lower cost together with environmental benefits this initiative lower the co2 emissions from our energy supply in around fifteen hundred tons during the first quarter of twenty twenty reinforcing our commitment towards sustainability we believe that the second semester of this year will continue to be challenging for the regional but maintain our conscious optimism on the same can have of the year due to the fact that economies such as panama on dudas in puerto rico took early actions on lockdowns and quarantine measures and in that sense we expect an early recovery in those economies thank you coming on i would also like to highlight the year for the phenomenon government to protect the local economy by imposing a thirty percent party to the impact of cement to the country which will have a positive impact on the competitive charity of the country we expect similarly strategies to be implemented from other governments in the caribbeans inflammatory conclusion i would like to refer now to our balance statement we close the first quarter with an debt to every ratio of four times which is lower to the ratio of the last school those twenty nineteen this result was driven by the fact that our dollar denominated editor was proportionally higher than our dollar denominated debt including our lower illustration in a scenario similar in tech and every time regarding the commitment that we had previously made from the learners in the company and reducing our net debt to the ratio i want to reassure you that even though we couldn't market conditions won't allow us to do that as soon as we were expecting we continue focus on obtaining that result in the mid term this temporary crisis has boosted our creativity our innovation and our savings initiatives and has been enforce the commitment of our people to add articles to the new market conditions we are calling to review the guidance provided on our last earnings call taking into account the impression market conditions that we are currently going through we expect to have a very view of our on our next earnings call finally i would like to close the call by asking you all to stay safe to take care of yourself and your loved ones and to comply with all the recommendations from your local authorities or models of social distancing thank you all for your attention operator we can close it now with the q and a section

press the pound or has okay our first question comes from <unk> with <unk> please go ahead hi good morning everyone and thanks for the call i have two questions my first one is regarding the result activities in columbia how do you think this assumption in scenario flower demand are you going to concentrate operations in just a few plans maybe planning on building inventories and then shutting down the kill any additional calls you could give us will be very helpful and my second question is regarding your divestment plan that you have decided to perform given market conditions are you still seeing this are you still expecting this to be carried out do you see it or do you see them you see it being executed more twenty twenty one thank you very much hello good morning i know thank you for for your questions uh <unk> you know this is starting on operations and there's the other piece that not any colonia but it's nothing like that are uh we're starting we have seen as better with the management idea that we are expecting uh we have a inventory of of seventeen multiple plants um so the other stuff is just like know your employees we will then proceed with uh this tracking our uh um ranking fields um in each of the in order for plants what they have is complete employees and going forward and we have fourteen for the first two or three months most likely we will only be <unk> in <unk> and <unk> but the other thing that is in mind is meeting with every time you expect it to there's a couple of questions so we are going to involve and start dealing with plants as soon as we meet the second question about the entire concern that we have that we have a lot of interest for the diversity of our attitudes in texas we have more than that we have parties here in the projects but we designed this to wait we're going to do that we have more <unk> in the back and then in terms of <unk> team on the us economy uh so it's might be really really easy because it's recorded it's you mentioned committee to execute our i guess plan to pick the letters that we want okay thank you very much the next question is from <unk> with own field investments <unk> thank you for taking the question i hope that uh your whole safe uh first of all i would like to clarify a couple of points uh i think you mentioned uh uh the target of fruition of capex of fourteen million this year i just would like to understand is it fourteen million less than last year of fourteen million less than your than the guidance that you were very integrated and the student points i would like to clarify even the pricing in columbia i think you mentioned a new crease that's that would be quite hi <unk> yeah oh could you could you speak with the we're not meeting very well around here thank you okay so <unk> to clarify a couple of points uh the the first the first point i like to clarify uh is on the capex you mentioned uh reduction of fourteen median of capex uh in twenty twenty uh is it fourteen less than last year or is it fourteen million less than the guidance that you gave in february and the second point is on the pricing and in columbia i think you mentioned an increase of thirteen point five percent of prices into one but uh you're mentioning <unk> prices uh i i i would just like to understand is it your <unk> thank you for thank you for the for the question i mean the package reduction of forty percent is uh uh it's um you know it's it's respectful of guidance not to last year it's forty years in other places our guidance of the even of the of the years and i i'm sorry but i came here instead of question uh the second part of the question was about the pricing in columbia you mentioned an increase of thirteen percent of equity prices in columbia but uh just would like to understand and uh whether i'm talking about in both races or your phone setting prices that's right this can be one of the questions about uh <unk> <unk> <unk> and the reality is that we are foreseeing that of course we need to continue with that critical is starting going forward starting the third quarter of of the year once a month start to record a little bit with the relationships we call them pressure the gap of the internal crisis these are used for party prices as white and so the reality is that uh we continue seeing that all these opportunity um to you for what he started with last week probably in columbia now where there's in terms of he was doing the providers in columbia if it was a strategy to eighty dollars and the reality of that on hours people party pricing in columbia okay thank you very much thank you our next that's good that's good that's good that's good that's good thank you very much for the call i hope everybody on the call is doing well and your family as well just very quickly two questions first on the the balance sheet was wondering what uh what the plans are for the refinancing or the kicking back of maturities that are on the balance sheet for twenty twenty and i got similarly how conversations with creditors are going on on waving covenance and then just on the operating side you mentioned in the release and in your remarks on the california state on that uh that you were expecting other countries in the caribbean and central american region to to follow panels lead on imposing in for tariffs i was wondering whether that's sort of an expectation based on your reading of the market or whether there's actual tangible comments or progress made by some of these markets already on this uh thank you good and i will start by answering this specific question and then i will um ask catalyst in the comments on our work and we will start again our conversations with the previous cases on that on the back and then the other thing that um with this funding we have seen uh the increased awareness of the local governments to uh incentivize the need to pick you know maybe both i'm in a position of employment with the local markets and that means that they would look after the research these are maybe three four years you'd have to do that over the summer with the thirty percent talent in the event and you have seen and seen that through the interviews needs to give you another example so we have high expectations based on the things that we have seen in the interviews and for the second person i think that's that's that's what i think that's very important to point or to express and change that to when this prices started for us in march twenty eight we had about three hundred and thirty million dollars of utilities for the rest of states in twenty short part we have road over about a hundred and fifteen million dollars with different channels uh up to three years uh in some in in in other cases two or three months of maturity that we have developed over a hundred percent of the of the lots of the of the facilities that that we have to allow it uh in the and really we do like twenty seven and the the the conference uh really were in permanent contact with the different banks um really the support has been great of of of all of all of them the second part of the question think about the weather we are expecting the conversations with the creatives with the creatives because we are requesting a weather for the for or some next what is uh really this is this is not just a this is not very well this is not just a situation of cement this is really a very general situation in the market right now uh the good thing is that i remember in the in the presentation that really we were in a very good friend uh uh in the back uh big down i mean we we ended much with very close to four times when they get the victim obviously because of these prices we are expecting to increase this level of operation operation that we are very you need to talk about the negotiation with about the place that's very clear thank you both very much and keep well okay thank you thank you all our next question is from <unk> with jp morgan thank you good morning everyone um i had one question on the um on the cost savings you can just provide us with more um uh comments on where the this fixed cost uh that you're paying uh to cut uh to come from and uh and then and then the second question that i had was if you can just um tell us what uh what happened to the pricing chris that you have planned uh in the us uh for april and uh and which you have executed already and and which you're planning to do for the rest of the year um good morning again and thank you for the for the questions i mean um the reality that uh we have uh become really good at uh you know optimizing or operations in the last few years and we've been challenges that we're taking from covid nineteen you know operations and we really need to continue uh accelerating the decision of our operating uh the savings will come from uh savings and maintenance and services and it's <unk> uh totaling uh close to between seventy five and one hundred million dollars uh we are fully confident that we will be able to achieve that that target uh for the the functionalities that we have for steam going going forward the savings will come from the us and from central america <unk> in columbia in terms of the prices scenario views i would like uh they wanted to be doing more code like uh uh what we have seen in the market uh adrian take the morning um as far as price as you suggest that we were looking for a price increase uh april the reality is that we had some good success early in a couple of markets mainly florida and doubts um you know fortunately given the situation rolling into the spring we pushed out the increase that was gonna be a strong move in april and we're monitoring the situation the best we can to kind of see you know what avenue were going down that's what's happening with the virus and the impact um but right now we're looking at something in the in the late second quarter maybe to push another price thank you and uh i'm gonna look back in just uh um on on on the cost savings these uh the low the lower costs on on from maintenance are not just for for this year or uh with those ones that we see great well and we'll have to be uh we'll have to be experienced you know again it's with the plans on the uh the main scenario that in that plan that that we have certainly confident that we will be able to achieve this savings for the patient and for the following year it will depend on the number of plans that we have in operations thank you so much thank you and our next question is from alexandra i'll be going with morgan stanley hi good morning thank you for the call for taking my quick yeah it's it's really related to um to what you're seeing on the ground so you did mention that volume in central america and the caribbean are about forty percent of volume of regular month so just wondering if you could add some commentary there for columbia and the you as of what you're seeing for april and may for the election of thank you for your question i would like that so much we're just to give you an idea of how what we do think about this in columbia first hello uh <unk> this is <unk> so when in april we we have the like the the first house of the month was you know pretty much a full stop only you know a few dispatches for uh infrastructure projects that were um you know able to continue operating but by the end of the month we were already uh reaching the forty percent of our daily dispatches so april april turns out um better than we talk um basically you know we have like as much volume as we actually in the quarantine in the month of may we are seeing um our volumes around fifty percent of what he needs to be uh to be a little more uh and uh you know to give you some more color about it we are we're seeing um you know surprisingly uh a great deal of activity you know compared to what we were expecting in the retail business uh which has you know become so far uh the majority you know the larger than in the industrial uh dispatches we are doing right now so as as of may the eleventh when you know these practices in in <unk> and many other students and the and the all weekly installs around the country should become available and online we we are seeing uh you know voice growing um as i said to a little bit more than than half of what we were discussing in the in the previous previous month and now we'll be able to provide us some color about the volumes in the us in april which we have very please great thank you and i was wondering thank you for the question um actually april was much stronger than we anticipated um i think initially there was some forecast where you may have weakening demand force the latter half but we were pleasantly pleased the volumes ended very strong um as for may so far this month uh we're seeing another sign of optimism at least the the first week um our volumes are tracking pretty close to plan and you know we do see in the future that there's going to be some level of slow down um in the residential segment i think probably to begin with and then maybe the commercial background as it works off it could slow but at this point it's kind of hard to predict when that might occur because you know at this point we thought we may see some slow down already but we have not um the impact that we had so far has been more weather related so again we're encouraged at this at this point and and forward to see what's gonna happen the rest of this month thank you <unk> still compliment uh the the the <unk> with some color about what's going on in the market since <unk> <unk> sure one um <unk> so the before we presented a broad estimate but in more detail uh on <unk> in fifteen days uh are opening during april we were able to dispatch uh around fifty percent of our project um <unk> as we said is uh still closing we have still dispatches and we have the means that we that the economy will reopen and uh next week starting with construction of of one as one of the sectors that reopens so that's uh a positive uh one of the news haiti is at a hundred percent of budget and has been for uh for the first uh four months of the year and the nineties is still strong for the minicom republic we did about forty percent of our of our normal dispatches and uh this with the with the construction um at a help and uh this was maybe between dispatches to um uh people that were doing uh inventory for for rich and other small um small construction so that's part of it uh also for uh for the country uh for the legal who has well has uh had a very long closure but uh the government has a different point in time reopened the um some uh areas which i for small hardware stores with initial dispatches uh two days a week and uh that along with textports we presented about twenty five percent of uh of the budget so uh and it also projected that uh twenty to reopen the construction sector uh also starting next week um the umps uh which had also uh closed in in most of the islands the budget was around forty percent as well and then you have <unk> with eighty four eighty five percent of uh of budget or just a fifteen percent deep line uh french <unk> was at a hundred and five percent of the budget so even though that there were measures taken by the government we did not see a a deep in indiana and uh the rest of the export markets were about uh seventy percent so uh we have seen a may with better demand that we that we uh had before april so that's uh uh i'm i'm encouraging thank you very much this was very clear and just a quick follow-up on your savings is it fair to assume that it will be proportionally split in all the countries i mean this ninety five to ninety million uh would it be proportional all across the us columbia and the caribbean uh yeah we had expected the highest savings in in columbia following like years and then buy a pcca alexander thank you very much thank you our next question comes from <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> okay hi roberto i'm sorry we can listen to you can you speak louder please i do i do listen now <unk> yeah it's okay okay thank you i'm sorry yes i have just a few questions the program can you tell me the part of the center pride variations in columbia the second is about any market show loss that people have in columbia in the quarter due to the in terms of a new competitor and last one the project's in columbia thank you uh thank you so what's recording is in enterprise what is in columbia five five percent um we continue um deploying with a lot of success over the strategies leading price security in the market uh you may have a list of uh you know a previous likely uh market journey in the cement business in columbia it was growing in excess of certain percent there's even a month through the doc everybody and we were basically flat but we were we were very pleased with the success of all this value of price recovery um we will have to wait until we have a more disability in the second quarter but we have very since with our market position in columbia okay i don't know if you would like to add a little bit more to the to the answer um well about the the 4g project estimation um we are seeing um you know all of the projects uh going strong uh financially solid skill and and um and and and we see our you know all of our customers very busy uh taking care of their employees with uh with all these you know very demanding products you know health and safety and uh um you know we we're we're still we are still seeing uh 4g as a as a main driver of of the men um that's pretty much what i wanted to okay regard to the time for your question yes yes thank you very much thank you and her next question is from <unk> with for the okay hi good morning and thank you for the presentation i i have two questions my first question is um could you spend more on the construction of the net debt a bit uh positive in ratio uh in dollars and what would we this indicator being including i f r s sixteen and using adjusted data and what are the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year with regard to rating agencies and my second question is um what is a medium term uh liquidity strategy and i'll look considering that the dividend payments that should happen in the in the second half of the year um were to be supported by the postpone uh divestors uh thank you all right thank you i'll look for the questions that would be like once it would be first time about this that uh that that's really that ration uh that's one but what what exactly is it we're still what what i would like to know is um for example in in what what what what i understood in the in the last uh report from reading agencies they they don't uh make a a a division on i f r s sixteen or or um and and and what what what from that side and then the other thing was on that okay no i i got it i got it yeah okay they that's the thing because they they they the the right legacy even if to the athletic system asset or of this yeah you don't need uh no they they they they they they the fully athletic sixteen is pretty similar it's pretty do you think that because our ratio just taking into account the the debt related to assets per year between us divided by the the appreciation have some applications like the in interest because of this this this is is right now four times for the division including the average fifty the the ratio is really close to four times that's the question yes and and what were the strategies to lower this indicator throughout the year no to the idea of the communicator that the idea like we are mentioning is obviously the productivity of the data of the second quarter and the plan quarter obviously right now is very complex for that reason we are taking all these measures like the the catholics the catholic scope and the cost savings and a lot of other measures in person that we pay to do ask uh as well what do we what is our current position in the creative is about five hundred uh five hundred fifteen uh three um you know seven i don't know video business and really the idea the idea is to end the second quarter with about in a in a very expressed scenario uh with uh with about three hundred billion specials really you know that's just the scenario but it's very important to highlight uh what is one experience or and family locations that competing with that situation area with the in the reality a through watch by far better than our initial scenario and may is going better by far as well for the declaration we're expecting that we are ending with a better procedure in terms of in terms of liquidity and we will we will want it to the the cash provision of the company with five week going forward uh depending on how things will play out right by you your confidence that what you're saying that we'll be able to record it with a good catch position okay thank you okay thank you our next question is from the legal centers with <unk> yeah good morning that thank you for the presentation i i also have two questions um in addition to the forms of rate secure that the april um carlos comments on expected recruiting levels uh are you expected to report further that increases throughout the rest of the year um also uh could you please mention the amount you have available to secure credit like that's a good question that's a good question that's a good question i understand that they shared that you have some group customers that are used as collateral for the great life you have in place and then will you be restricted to sell them for at least part of it if you if you need to do something thank you for the first part of the <unk> we are we are we are a high level of problem communities we are working tomorrow another extra fifty million dollars that now uh all of the people none of that that we operate as um uh insurance of liquidity really because really we don't need this extra liquidity that really needs to have he's actually creating our house um we have been working in this extra amount this is not something later in the visit that we were mentioning and um with this new the design we really we've been in a very good position of the creative for for very for for many for many months and with the tutor is a collateral on sales line now we don't have any okay our next question is from <unk> hello guys thanks for taking my question and stay safe uh just on competitive dynamic in columbia i know you already mentioned a little bit but if you could comment a little bit with regards to the the improvement that you're seeing in the input part pricing and the slide market trail that you had in the quarter could you comment a little bit more on what you expect coming forward in terms of market share what are you seeing from from the market as a whole with with the pricing increase that you made in the first quarter thank you very much thank you <unk> the market columbia always behaving in a in a very good way and in the uh first half of march uh with the um increasing demand the last year the close to five hundred thousand points plus the seven percent increase in the mind to everybody the reality is that the competitive landscape was uh in my opinion positive um nobody was really competing on prices because it's a huge gap in the prices that we have is that important part of the crisis and the intention of uh uh you know of uh everybody to uh reward the baby because of of capital and the scientists that live in in columbia um i would expect that scenario to uh continue the same way going forward once they might start to to recall uh so far we are extremely pleased with the reaction of the market in april and may and in our opinion our competitive position has a strength uh in this very start of the of the economy because the two relationships that we have with our clients and the technical um i think sense that we provide to them in our opinion have a superior value for the decision for the industry statement of the market and we are the in my opinion the only seven player in columbia who access directly and why they're going to have a discussion in the concert with you right and you know going diagnostic to more than five thousand have a discourse so in our opinion um our value for the position uh will be a important assets for us going forward uh we don't foresee anybody competing on prices no matter what scenario of demand plays out going forward it used to be um significant gap in prices in terms of the price and what i wanted to add that uh during this quarter we gained market share in the industrial business where we suffered uh the most by the end of of last year uh particularly in the rex business so uh we are we are uh as strong as as we've always been in that industrial part of the of the market but the law whole market share has been uh mostly focused on on the retail business but it's where we have been uh you know recovering prices faster we have done uh a huge faster than our competitors and that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's you know it's pretty much uh a very good move to have done it before this crisis uh because otherwise you know uh competitors will be uh they were saying uh forced or or um incentivized you know to to to recover uh value as well for their for for their companies in uh in um you know more stressful uh mark so we are we are always you know to to recover the market share uh with uh healthcare prices uh you know we are seeing today and and uh you know uh implementing prices have been um you know a very good indicator of of uh of the you know the that direction where where national prices should go and in this case uh this is pointing in the you know in the in the right direction i'm just thank you very much great to you thank you our next question is from stephanie <unk> with credit corp capital good morning thank you very much for the presentation i have uh two questions uh my first question is uh regarding the distribution of your passcode uh what proportion would you say it takes and what proportion would you say it's variable and then my second question is uh regarding the competitive dynamics in on good as you mentioned the presentation that you had at price decreases so i would like to have a little bit more detail in that front thank you <unk> for your question uh <unk> <unk> <unk> and regarding honduras the reality that uh you started to see the dynamic in the market um in twenty twenty january and february were very good month in terms of demands so things were going way better than you know do this and with the report of the market that <unk> mentioned in april uh they they still don't have enough disability um and we get more weeks really know what is going to be like the normal demanding you know do this again but after now we are pleased with the dynamics if the market continues recording uh we foresee us in our in which we can start um uh practical strategy in honduras similar to the one that we are executing in colonial i don't know if you would like to add some some color you know and all right this uh just just to mention that um this this was previously addressed as well but the the talent is something that is being discussed so that could potentially uh basically as well as the direction of the of the project in the market um and uh again starting on december uh following due to the middle of uh march we had a very strong demand uh in the country which which i think is uh is very positive we'll see how the recovery goes and um what uh programs does the um the government implement to sort of uh recover the economy uh but but um definitely construction sector for a country like <unk> is a critical sector to great thank you very much thank you our next question is from <unk> with <unk> good morning everybody and thank you for the presentation i found very interesting to your comments about uh uh significant decline of uh cement and team care in ports in columbia this year and also the co the parties that were implemented in <unk> potentially the implemented in <unk> as well so i would like to understand uh how much uh imports represent from each of those markets i mean how much uh uh importance either semano king care represent of the columbia seman market of two thousand and nineteen and if you can share the same number <unk> and <unk> will be very helpful thank you thank you um and <unk> uh important into the we are uh mainly clean care last year close to six hundred thousand pounds uh in pushing to hundreds and paramount close to a push into the market in each of those markets uh cement and i'm gonna do that as well on the only cement uh in our opinion there is a trend in our uh conscious towards uh you know supporting of having these kids just to protect employment and especially in a place such as columbia where the prices are way below input by the tigers if that didn't make any sense for the country to uh use uh you know falling reserves to input think when we have enough local capacity uh to supply the the industry local into the different users so in our opinion that is a thing that will pretty very going for work on this that's very helpful thank you thank you our next question is hi thank you for the call this morning um i hope you have been well in <unk> and you're uh well like your loved ones uh congrats on the nice performance on marketing this in <unk> despite the huge drop in volume that tells you a little bit about what you're doing congrats on that the question that i have on the united states first what does it take commercially to be ready to be better positions to sell more uh cement to what it needs to infrastructure uh projects and secondly um uh this do you think that the overall uh performance in dentally a related regions in the united states might be affected more compared to other regions within the united states thank you so much to part cool thank you for your questions and then what as well very pleased with the the four months of our business in columbia needs to be an idea what is our marketing platform like in january and it's already doesn't access of thirty aspects <unk> and uh <unk> when they start picking up we are very confident that the professor <unk> will continue improving in a significant way think about this this market i would like to be able to take the question yeah i just thank you this morning um with your question regarding the infrastructure you like we feel like we are very well positioned to take on more of that opportunity as it presented itself uh we think it's gonna be much bigger going forward but the reality is as of now in two one ninety team we had about five percent that represented about five percent of our volume and in q1 two thousand and twenty it's representing about eight percent of our volume so you know we have been focusing on that so we feel like we're pretty good situation and you know you do see some increased demand there to be able to take advantage of it thank you thank you much given and given the differences in demand from covid nineteen from <unk> yeah i want to tell you i don't think that we are seeing any different in this in demand from last metropolitan then it's yeah that's great i think there will be a different one i think you know of monitoring that as we go because the local and big governments you know they kind of make some of their own decisions and where we have you know revenues on polls and we have um uh you know things that that help fund the highway the gas tax and things like that wherever wherever there's differences there there could be differences in demand as well but we keep an eye on that by state perfect got you so thank you so much thank you you're welcome in our next question is from my best with database analysis um thank you very much uh my question is on energy cost um they were doing i think in columbia eight point eight percent in q1 what is the outlook for energy costs in columbia please for the rest of the year um secondly in the us uh were there any savings in or diesel costs of significance in q1 and again what's the outlook for the rest of the year if you could and then finally on your reset initiative does it include the benefit of lower energy cost expected this year or the be on top of the reset initiative cost savings thank you thank you <unk> <unk> the reality is that in columbia energy project decreasing significant away from last year for the beginning of the year we are seeing them on single as we have the first quarter of of the year in the year we have seen significant uh um savings in asia from our early makes uh fleet um significant that makes very good very good performance because of the lower values of of all so in general we are focusing uh m m march first and are in terms of and the enterprises in all of our regions <unk> central american <unk> all of them consider even for some technical importance so the reality in terms of energy customer they they will be um very favorable uh going forward in all of the of the three judges with <unk> a little bit back to kind of a little bit more on the specifics of it it's true and more than work one uh from my part and this is from a simple um i would just like to add the uh the impact of these uh energy cost reduction on a valuable cost in columbia as very significant as of today are a valuable cost per ton including uh frank's acquisitions of <unk> and others uh feeling what processes are gambled so our average uh valuable costs in columbia is twenty dollars uh and it goes very very much lower uh you know it sounds like a hand up for example so that is that is a uh a great effects of of the uh of these prices in col longer we are using um mostly cold today uh as as a gas is nominated in dollars uh so but but there is a very good uh availability of of cold um uh uh a big moment and there are slightly to diversify uh our our team materials with uh with the alternatives it's also also came back as we are using uh chip tires and uh you know biomass and other uh different types of fuels and we're seeing you know good opportunities uh to to start meeting um urban uh residents uh converting into fuels for the for the so so we we're seeing a good uh you know a good outlook in in terms of fuels for for this year and collaboration thank you um everyone i can i can compliment on uh <unk> and uh and for <unk> uh we we have uh of course committed the the solar um uh generation field in <unk> which uh has a uh significantly more of costs or you know other costs uh prior to the to the local um energy that's available uh so there we're seeing significant cities um we're also uh installed or putting in in operation a um a uh solid fuel storage in the northern part of the of the country uh we were before we were buying um um head hope from a local supplier and now we were able to bring in uh um uh shifts of uh thirty to forty thousand tons which uh gives it a a very uh good head of um negotiating prices so you know we're seeing prices uh reduced by ten to fifteen by which was done so that's gonna have uh also a point of uh impacting the cost of the operation and in particular we had uh negotiated a call uh last year which was um much better with the project that we we had uh before but we expect to to have of course better pricing due to the uh fuels um uh or the commodity prices uh decline in the future of the operation um and we're also looking at uh uh implementing or uh um looking at different solutions for for energy in countries which we still have uh high cost uh such as in data and in portfolio um cause other other countries such as uh animal and initially public we have uh very competitive uh uh construction negotiated with local energy suppliers thank you very much thank you very much thank you for coming well just to compliment what you said for the us stance and like with respect to diesel i mean we have seen some um at the time especially in our rating business but again i think you're correct you feel like we're gonna see more of that as the year goes on just because of those happening with the situation in general thank you thank you for that can i just then follow up is are those savings from all those fuel savings you've been talked about are they in the reset numbers or are they on top of the reset numbers they will be on top of the visit uh numbers uh yeah so that's it in the viral cost i mean visit we are basically um addressing fixed uh cost and topics excellent thank you very much and stay safe thank you and our last question is come one here would ask more hi good morning thank you um could you provide uh could you provide us with an interview for the working capital requirements of the business we saw an increase in in inventory and and receivable so can can you tell us how these these accounts are behaving thank you thank you one thank you for your question <unk> can you uh give us some sort of the capital management okay <unk> the working capital the behavior of the working capital so far from the beginning of these cases has been very good we are going through they almost at this level of the organization that they <unk> almost every every one of the programs of the of the uh i think that that's that makes having a situation like uh like like this one um that the the there's there's to give you a lot of a little a little bit more color in the case of the columbia and like very well uh we've talked the operations in the in the last ten days so much that we have collected uh about ninety billion more than ninety different persons during april not not selling but we are we are we are collecting the receivables and we are as well to place a plan in order to do the is the level of the events are risking a lot of the three three years and that is growing one as well uh for that reason the idea is to have a a really good control in the in all of the three lines they're working capital and we can't see that we have the we have we have a structure of the say thank you no problem thank you and i'm not showing any further questions in the future so once again thanks a lot for connecting to our conference call today stay safe i'm looking forward to seeing you in our next conference call have a great day and with our ladies and gentlemen we conclude our pro thank you for your participation have a great day
