welcome to the eversource energy q3 twenty twenty results conference call my name is john and i will be operator for today's call at this time all participants <unk> only mode later we will conduct a question and answer session during the question and answer session if you do have a question press star then one on your touch phone phone please note that this conference is being recorded and i will now turn the call over to jeffrey cotton thank you very much john good morning and thank you for joining us i'm jeff cotton eversource energy vice president for investor relations during this call we'll be referencing slides that we posted last night on our website and if you can see on slide one some of the statements made during this in ester call may be forward looking as to find within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the us private securities litigation reform act of nineteen ninety five the forward looking datements are based on management's current expectations and our subject to risk and uncertainty which may cause the actual results to differ materialally for forecast and projections these factors are set forth in the news release issued yesterday additional information about the various factors that may cause actual results to differ can be found in our annual report on form ten k for the year ended december thirty first two thousand nineteen and our form ten q for the three months ended june thirtieth two thousand twenty additionally our explanation of how and why we use certain non gap measures and how those measures reconcile to gap results is contained within our news release and the lives we posted last night and in our recent ten k seeking today will be phil embo our executive vice president and cfo also joining us today our joe nolan our executive vice president for strategy customer and corporate relations john <unk> our treasure and senior vp for finance and regulatory and j booth our controller now i will turn slide two and turn over the call to fill uh thank you jeff uh good morning everyone hope everyone on the call remains healthy and that your families are safe and doing well uh this morning i'll cover a variety of areas uh review the results of the third quarter uh discuss recent regulatory that elements including the acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts and provide an update on recent developments around our offshore wind partnership with horses i'll start with slide two uh noted that recurring earnings were one dollar and two cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with recurring earnings of ninety eight cents per share in the third quarter of two thousand nineteen gap results which include a charge of one cent per share relating to the recently completed acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts told one dollar and one cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty in the first nine months of twenty twenty are recurring earnings excluding columbia gas acquisition cost total two dollars and eighty cents per share compared with recurring earnings of two dollars and sixty nine cents per share in the first nine months of two thousand nineteen and uh excluding the uh northern path transmission impairment charge gap results for september of this year were uh two dollars and seventy six cents per share during our business segments our electric uh distribution segment earn sixty cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with earnings of sixty one cents per share in the third quarter of two thousand nineteen the lower earnings were results of both higher storm restoration costs and property tax expense as well as the impact of uh of shared delusion our electric transmission segments earned thirty six cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with recurr earnings of thirty three cents per share in the third quarter of two thousand and nineteen improved results uh would driven by the continued investment and reliability in our transmission facilities uh partially offset by your delusion our natural gas distribution segment lost four cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with a loss of five cents per share in the third quarter of last year improved results with due to revenues i should note that because we didn't close on our acquisition of columbia gas of massachusetts assets until october ninth the transaction had no impact uh on this the gas segment this segment uh during the quarter uh each quarter this year uh we've booked acquisition related costs at the parent and have segregated them for uh increased transparency beginning in the fourth quarter of this year ongoing results of our new gas franchise which is named every source of gas company of massachusetts will be reflected in the natural gas segment integration related costs however we'll continue to be recorded separately at the parent and excluded from our recurring gap earnings our water distribution segment earned seven cents per share in the third quarter of twenty twenty compared with earnings of six cents per share in the third quarter of two thousand nineteen improved results um we're due to a three three and a half million dollar after tax gain on the sale of our hemo massachusetts area facilities uh to the town mso's parent are in three cents for share in the third quarter of twenty twenty excluding the columbia gas of massachusetts at that acquisition cost uh equal to our earning in the third quarter of last year as you probably noted in our earnings release and can see on july three we are reaffirming our twenty twenty earnings per share guidance of three dollars and sixty cents to three dollars and seven be sense and it is excluding the non-recurring costs related to the purchase of columbia gas of massachusetts assets but you're also reaffirming a long term eps growth rate of five to seven percent from a core regulated business through the year twenty twenty four we continue to be uh to expect to be somewhere around the middle of that range uh largely due to the investments we need to make on behalf of our customers as we thought why view uh earlier in the year as a reminder uh while we fully expect the columbia gas assets to be accretive to our earnings per share starting immediately uh in twenty twenty one we have not yet updated our long term financial outlook to reflect the acquisition of columbia gas uh assets in our uh capital uh capex and our earnings growth in addition as we disclose previously earnings from offshore wind would the incremental to our core uh business growth will provide a comprehensive update of our regulated capital investment forecast uh adding in uh a source gas company massachusetts projections and providing update of our offshore wind partnership during our year end call in late february for the third quarter result alternatives like four in our experience restoring power after tropical storm e s i s uh ravage connecticut on october fourth we serve a hundred forty nine uh cities and towns in connecticut and every one of these communities suffered damage from e s i s uh much of it catastrophic as you can see on the slide we had nearly twenty two thousand damage locations that we had to address and brought in an army of electric restoration and tree crews to restore power all the while working on restoration in a pandemic setting the restoration process lasted nine days meaning we completed our work one to two days faster than we had in the last two tropical storms that hit connecticut even though we had a thirty to thirty five percent more damage location and most importantly we completed that work safely with no serious electrical contact and no covid exposure among the enormous work for us we brought to connect okay just a tremendous effort uh by all of our employees from across all parts of of eversource at this time we estimate this deferred cost across all three states will total more than two hundred seventy five million dollars with the vast majority that's um uh incurred in connecticut that figure will be adjusted as the actual invoices are received what's the we're still actively pursuing uh invoices from hundreds of vendors that assisted us during the statewide uh restoration effort uh where we were setting new polls or hanging miles new wires or replacing hundreds of transform is these related costs uh to be capitalized the ultimate recovery of storm costs and the evaluation of performance uh in safely and that's additionally restoring power to our customers is pending an ongoing review by the connecticut public utilities regulatory authority or pure that review is scheduled to be completed in late april of twenty twenty one sticking with our regulated business i'll direct the slide i'm fine and a review of this year's uh distribution rate reviews this past friday the massachusetts department of public utilities issued its decision in the end start gas rate review you that we filed last year it supports our continued investment in the n star gas system on behalf of our three hundred thousand customers the decision allows n star gas to increase distribution revenues by twenty three million always on an annualized basis the vp approves an hourly of nine point nine percent and a capital structure with a fifty four point seven seven percent equity it also permits us to implement performance east rate making for a 10-year term that uh would sound uh operating performance by ansar gas will target annual base rate increases of inflation plus one point zero three percent this is an sharing mechanism that would return seventy five percent of the benefit to customers should we see the hourly of ten point nine percent sharing mechanism on the downside if our hourly falls below eight point four percent also exciting is the decision also approves our first ever geothermal pilot program our other one standing rate proceeding involves public service of new hampshire in financial last month we and all the parties to the ps and h rate case filed a proposed settlement in the rate review that that has been pending for nearly you know a year and a half you can see from the slides we settled on a forty five million dollar annualized rate increase that includes a nine point three percent return on equity and a fifty four point four percent equity layer should regulators approve the settlement the permanent increase would take effect in january january first of twenty twenty one you may recall that the new hampshire public utility commission allowed us to implement a temporary rate increase of approximately twenty eight million back in july july first of twenty nineteen the final approved rates would be retroactive back to that date or eighteen months uh we would uh recover that in a true up uh over the course of the year twenty twenty one we can settle consider the settlement a constructive outcome to ps and h's first general increase and about a decade and i've asked the the new hampshire pc to approve the settlement before the end of november from the rate review review is i'll turn to slide six and our recently completed acquisition of the assets of columbia gas of massachusetts uh for one point one billion dollars of cash uh excluding working capital adjustments most of these assets were signed to every source gas company in massachusetts uh a new subsidiary i mentioned that we formed a may of twenty twenty as you can see in the slide much of s source gas as service territory is adjacent to end star gas are yanky gas service territories additionally uh and star electric already provided electric service to about twenty of the communities that ever source gas service with natural gas as a result we expect to realize operational benefits for a newest three hundred thirty thousand natural gas customers uh and the communities where where they live to finance the transaction we sold approximately five hundred million of equity um in in june and we finance the death portion of the transaction in august and again we are very confident that this transaction will be created to our earnings per share in twenty twenty one and incrementally created in the years ahead to a critical factor in ensuring that this transaction brings benefits to all stakeholders is an eight year rate plan that we negotiated with the massachusetts attorney general and other key parties prior to our filing with the massachusetts to department of public utilities the key elements of that plan are listed on slide seven it will allow us to make the necessary investments in our episource gas of mass system and reflect those investments in rates in a reasonably time we may have know very thankful that the dpu approved the settlement in the acquisition very quickly uh now that we have the teeth to the property and in a long-term plan in place we are we have focused on providing our new eversource gas customers with the same high level of service that we provide our other five hundred fifty thousand national gas distribution company customers that we have in massachusetts and connecticut as i noted earlier we plan to integrate and resource gas of massage uses into our updated five year projections that will provide you in february we continue to project approximately three billion of regulated company capital investments this year despite the challenge of goes by the pandemic and the need to take crews off of capital projects for a significant part of august to deal with the aftermath of tropical stormy saudis through september our capital investments totaled approximately two point two billion dollars that's approximately the same level as this time last last year in two thousand nineteen we made considerable progress on our transmission capital program in the third quarter putting several projects into service at or below budget is these benefits of of uh the lower costs will flow through to the new england's electric customers from the regulated business of turn to offshore wind partnership uh with or stead uh on slide eight we've had a few developments since july thirty first earnings call uh the most significant development was that in august the bureau of ocean energy management posted a complete review schedule for our one hundred thirty megawatt south fort project online island the schedule culminates in a decision on a construction and operations permit or cop as it's known in me january of twenty twenty two we are also making progress on the other permits in september we filed a settlement proposal with the new york department of public service to resolve much of the stakeholder feedback related to the structured operations and maintenance of the project that lies within new york jurisdiction in october several of new york state agency signal they support for this proposal by signing on to the agreement restructured in agreement on host community payments in the necessary real estate rights with the town of east hampton where the actual cable will land and will be connected to the long island grid new york called the service commission signing hearings for software is scheduled to commence the first week of december we continue to expect the state signing process to be completed in twenty twenty one before bone issues that based on that schedule we now expect the project and to service in the fourth quarter of twenty twenty three this is consistent with the expectations we disclosed during our may and july earnings calls while we were still waiting for the review schedule turning to our other projects you recall that we filed our bone application for revolution wind in march we expect phone to establish a review schedule for that project in the first quarter of twenty twenty one would you not expect to provide an updated in-service state for this project until the schedule is issued but at this point it is unlikely that the project will have to service at the end of twenty twenty three also we filed our sunrise wind application with bone on september first and expect bone to establish a review schedule for the project next year once we receive that review schedule we'll be able to better estimate a more up-to-date in service schedule but again at this time it would seem that the end of twenty four in service is not likely we are very optimistic about our offshore in business expect to many opportunities over the coming months and years to expand our offshore wind partnership beyond the seventeen hundred and fourteen megawatts currently on the contract as we mentioned before we have enough lease capacity to construct at least four thousand megawatts on the five hundred and fifty square miles of ocean tracks that we have under long term lease off the southeast coast of massachusetts to this point on a october twentieth we submitted a number of alternative bids into the second new york offshore wind esp where the state is looking for between a thousand and twenty five hundred megawatts new york state officials have indicated that they expect to announce the winner or winners before the end of the year our sunrise projects uh as a reminder one of the largest portion of new york's first rmp last year uh eight hundred and megawatts additionally just last week rhode island governor gina orlando announced that her state will target early next year for issuing an rsp for six hundred megawatts of additional offshore wind as you know the majority of our revolution wind capacity uh four hundred megawatt will be sold to rhode island with the balance of going to connecticut uh uh thank you very much for joining this this morning and i'll turn the call back over to john thanks phil and i'll turn the call back to john just remind you how to enter questions in the q and a q thank you if you do have a question press star then one on your touch phone phone once again let's start with one on your touch phone phone if you wish to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key thank you john our first question this morning is from char from google good morning sure good morning jeff good morning phil good morning sure so a couple of questions here um just just some of your language around sort of the growth rate um you know obviously which still excludes be a gas and offshore went obviously these are you know very creative and you're already conservatively kind of well within your band so should we sort of be thinking about these incremental items as potentially rating your growth rate to maybe six to eight percent then or something that will hit you to the top end and then sort of extend that runway with your current trajectory i mean the reason we ask is six to eight percent seems to be sort of that new top quartile bucket in our space where five to seven percent be coming a little bit more typical so here's how you're sort of thinking about this do you see value to be a talk to be in the top quartile or you don't think you need to be rewarded for it so curious on that as we think about emailing it's planned sure uh sure thanks for the question and what you've been doing well um uh certainly the addition of columbia gas and uh will be uh additive to our existing uh forecast so uh we're we're looking through all the details of that so we're able to provide you with a full uh update in february but we we expect to get um a significant benefit from that from that franchise and it's saying uh we also spec uh as those offshore wind projects come online uh online to also be additive uh to remind folks i know i said it but and you did that the five to seven percent growth rate is from the from the existing core business which doesn't include uh columbia uh assets it also doesn't include um you know grid modernization activities that are currently pending in in connecticut and new hampshire or or am i that that that uh could could be a potential uh to move forward um relatively soon in massachusetts uh in terms of picking a look at that by the by the regulator so um i see that we have a number of levers to uh grow and grow at um at even a higher rate than the expected before got it that's helpful uh and then uh just lastly for me is can you just maybe talk a little bit about your expectations for the legislation in connecticut i mean the legislation that passed was more constructive than the draft legislation but obviously some disappointment with the refunds and penalties offset by the potential upside for like pbs so sort of how are you guys thinking about this entirely uh sure the uh energy legislation we we've said consistently that uh pbr is a is a formula and a template that that that we think is effective we have pbr structures in in other states and um we think that um having a a robust discussion on pbr in in connecticut makes a lot of sense so we're very very supportive of that provision you know really uh you know the energy legislation uh directed pure to to evaluate that and open a docket by the middle of next year so uh june of twenty twenty one and it it authorizes uh pure to you know establish storm standards and potential penalties as you as you mentioned there isn't there is an increased potential um of penalties uh currently those penalties are two and a half percent of our distribution revenues in connecticut and that goes up goes up to four percent so you know it also gives you some additional time you know to review cases so you know which is also something that you know seems to be appropriate so um the the legislation as you as you indicated uh is out there uh and uh pure is working through the details of it and we expect the uh working through that in a constructive way with them over the next several months got it terrific that's all i had today uh thanks guys all right thanks char our next question is from steve fleshman i'm wolf good morning steve good morning um can you hear me yes steve i can yeah great uh so just question on the the in your ultra wind projects could you maybe talk to i know we don't know the exact timing but how should we think about the impact on the economics of those projects from from delay a uh or puts in cakes and is it hurting the economics of the projects you've already have signed up to yeah um thanks for your question steve and i hope you and your family are doing well um i guess to to go to put some takes uh uh piece you know i i don't think that uh folks should automatically think that um schedule changes result in uh ups or down there's of benefits or that that people may not um may not consider in that so certainly um if you are looking at um adjusted schedules you might be able to adjust your installation vessel optimization better um you know uh the turbine sizes themselves are getting larger so you could um move to larger turbine sizes if if uh projects are do at a la a time period versus an earlier time period and certainly the cost um supply chain and availability of materials and supply chain is only getting better so so i'd say that um you know there's opportunities for improved uh cost uh economics as you move into a schedule that uh you know you may not think of you know i think people generally think of projects as you know is a delay it's a cost increase but that there are are other elements that work here on the offshore wind business that um offset that how about how about any negatives is it how about like do you lose are you gonna lose any tax credits or anything else yes like it's just time value yeah um uh in terms of the schedules we're looking at uh we don't expect to have any impact on our tax uh assumptions but certainly uh significant delays um las could have impacts on on your tax assumption delays could also have uh impacts on uh contracts that you have with uh counter parties but um in our specific case so that's the general case in our specific the case uh we're confident that we have the ability to work within both of those uh the tax area and the contract area in an effective way with uh where we see the schedules going in the future okay thank you thank you our next question is from angie from seaport global good morning angie good morning um so i have a question about massachusetts you know you guys have this uh very constructive uh decision for insert gas but the state um is currently looking at the future of gas lvcs um and so how do you guys see especially in mind of the fact that you just uh uh acquired uh uh an additional uh gas utility in messages uh uh good morning angie and uh thank you for your question and hope you're doing well um uh you know the way that i would have positioned it the way that uh i think people should think about it is that there's nobody first of all who's uh more aggressive in terms of looking at clean energy strategies and carbon reduction and every source in terms of having a carbon neutral goal by twenty thirty uh we have worked effectively with all parties in in in all states but in massachusetts where uh the attorney general and others on a take a look at um you know sort of the the future or the outlook in terms of the the the gas business um we've we've been working with uh these intervening parties for for many years and we'll continue to work with from on what we think an appropriate uh strategy is there so um this is a long term um uh outlook in terms of the that the state wants to you know be have aggressive clean energy and and carbon reduction um targets uh with fully supportive of that and we we look forward to working you know with all the parties there but we don't see it as a as a threat to the uh gas distribution business um uh in the region at all okay and and in connecticut um you know this this recent uh back and forth between you guys and poorer about the extension of uh the at the lack of basically disconnections on the back of covid um i mean it sounds a bit concerning uh that poor is pushing back so strong that they don't need to sign off on that extension um i mean i would assume that it's uh a natural practice normal practice for a regulated utility to seek a recovery of this uh you know under recovered revenues um can you give us a sense you know how you see it in connecticut um given the latest um you know legislative changes and also some deterioration and and you know negative relationships in the state um yes so we are not doing uh shutoffs uh across all any a franchise at this point and specifically you know we're working you know we're working with customers we're working with um fuel agencies assistance agencies on uh an approach here that works that work best of customers we've also engaged with pura as you mentioned and other government officials um you know on this issue so i'm i'm i'm confident that we'll get to a good place here you know nobody wants to uh burden customers with with any more than than we're all ready all of us or burden with in terms of the economic conditions and covid et cetera so um we're we're working through the issue uh we're working with customer as i say and some of the assistance agencies and um uh i'm sure we'll get to a a good outcome here very good thank you thank you angie uh next question is from julie in from bank of america good morning julian hey good morning team thanks for the time i hope uh all of you doing well and save uh families as well um perhaps just to to pick up off of uh or uh clarify if i can some of the last rounds of quite um when you talk about uh the the four q roll forward are you gonna be rolling to twenty twenty five and then more specifically how do you think about including or excluding officer wind in light of the uncertainties described should we expect that off or when should continue to be at least um for those projects where there's an un uh determined date to continue to be excluded there uh julie thanks for your question and your comments that i hope and hope you're you and your family doing well too um just to we will uh our history has been to um add another year into the into the outlook so twenty twenty five would be that that year since our forecast goes through the twenty twenty four time period so that is something that uh you should expect to see and really our our view on how to look at offshore wind it doesn't change by by any of the schedule items we talked about today or we've looked at it as um showing the core business as the as the driver and the foundational element of the of the growth rate and then to show that wind is attitude to that in in what way so that would be the intense going forward i think that um when i've been asked this question before the answer is is was and still is as more years of when to come in to the actual result of that particular a year then to me it makes more sense to roll it all together but at this stage the expectation especially in this upcoming february update would be to have the core business extend that through twenty twenty five and then uh show uh offshore wind uh in addition to that and if you don't mind elaborating a little bit further i know that there's a certain degree of uncertainty on exactly the perming schedule that inhibits your ability to say when these projects are reaching service can you at least try to put some more parameters around what each of these pieces of the process could take so that there's like a window if you will it may be too early yeah so in terms of um you know there's there's uh people have uh realized out there and and we've been asked questions i think you've asked us uh the questions in terms of you know what with delay vineyard wind and other things uh there's been some delays in terms of bone notice of intense uh of intense and and to prepare their environmental impact statement and frankly we would've we would've expected uh in our original schedule uh schedules that some of these um uh analogs you know to prepare the the environmental impact statement would be would be out by now so these are expected i believe um you know the the plan schedule for reviewing uh uh and releasing these is is underway so i wouldn't expect uh you know a significant change in the schedule but uh at this stage it would be uh proven to see that the the schedule that comes out of the phone before we commit to a final uh in service date i wouldn't expect it to be significant got it excellent all right i'll pass from there thank you so much steve all right thanks julian uh next question is from <unk> from evercore good morning <unk> hey good morning guys thanks for taking my question uh sure just just following up on the you know the the offshore wind here what to expect you know there's this uh e s uh decision i suppose that is going to be out or e state and rather this month or or early december what to expect there and then how does that impact your your future project guidelines yeah the um these notice a bit of intense that they contain um a plan schedule you know that that in the n lives uh they have contained bones plans schedule for reviewing each of the cops so that would be an important um piece of information to to have available so that that's really the what's included in that is a point and schedule for reviewing the cop that that comes out with the notice of intense right so i guess maybe i'm talking about the environmental impact statement isn't there an environmental impact statement that boom is supposed to sort of put out here in the in the next few weeks you're talking about the one for vineyard right yes yes oh okay yeah i'm not um i apologize you um you probably you have to ask uh <unk> about that okay but that that doesn't have a readthrough for you or your actual in project i guess that's that's what my question was well certainly um all of the developers off the coast uh you know that we've been going through this cumulative impact study and and looking at spacing and um of of wind turbines and we came up with a one medical mile by one not a mild spacing so certainly uh there could be components that come out in any decision for um vineyard wind that you'd have to you know take a look at to see if it has any impacts uh you know to other developers and leading us but um in terms of what might be in that or the exact timing um i think a vineyard might might have a better perspective of that okay perfect that's all i had guys thank you so much all right thanks josh uh next question is from jeremy from jp morgan good morning jeremy good morning thanks for having me i just wanted to start off with uh what are the benefits of looping content into the proposed sunrise two uh sunrise wind to rfp here eversource has experience of building transmission and we're curious what additional competitive advantages connect provides here to this specific project uh can you provide detail on potential ownership interests for each entity and does ownership interest change once construction is complete in the project as in service uh thanks for your question here i hope you hope you're doing well i guess i would say on the first part of the question that um sort of obviously coned has a local knowledge of uh of new york and their service territory and the and the network and the operation of the transmission and delivery system that um that are valuable uh uh to any party if you if you're operating in new york so i'd say they bring a knowledge and skill set of of the area that uh certainly we don't have um you know as as depth of knowledge as they would so um certain skill sets there as a local uh player would bring um so in terms of you know what the um components of a relationship would be those things are all to be discussed as we as we move through but it's certainly um beneficial i think to the project to have uh somebody with um a client skillsets involved got it and as far as potential ownership interest is there any kind of thoughts on how that could uh develop um not at this time no got it and then will the delay in offshore wind permitting have any impact on the current financing plans is it fair to assume the seven hundred million of equity in your current five year plan moves to the back end here and how is offshore wind capex spending track peter date versus the three to four hundred million range that you expected um we haven't just a range that we've expected we've we've talked about how much we expected to to spend um you know this year you know you know um you know just for uh the year twenty twenty uh and it's tracking somewhat close that i would say is probably a little bit under what we expected at this time um in terms of the financing uh you're right that uh we announced a year ago you know there's two billion dollar as a of equity need that would support the forecast and we we issued one point three of that so there's seven hundred million remaining that um and i would say the same thing as i've said all along as we'd be a opportunistic and consider what our capital forecasts are and what the market conditions are um you know as we look to um uh fulfill the rest of that uh offering that we discussed got it that's helpful i'll leave it there thank you thank you all right thanks jeremy uh next question is from paul patterson from glen rock good morning paul good morning guys good morning paul um i just wanted to follow up on the the uh the draft decision in connecticut uh on monday and um what your thoughts were on it um any if it were in fact to become a final order what the uh what the potential impact uh could be are you talking about the draft um information on on rates or what can you be most specific sure there was a draft decision on on monday in the uh the per case uh associated with uh with the rates right the the rate review that was reversed um that proceeding i i i can tell you that the specific name um no that's okay i you know i just wanted to um i just wanted to be specific cause as somebody else mentioned there's been a number of different um yeah i remember a lot yeah uh so this um so as you recall the uh the pure suspended rates uh that we had implemented over the summer both we and uh ui to to take an additional look i think this is what you're referring to so we did receive the draft order and really it's kind of hot off the press were currently um a value waiting that and um and and we're going to you know see what comments we might have in comments on the draft to do um i think it's the the twelfth of november so we have some time to to flush out anything but it's concern with uh on first blush i'd say it's consistent with um pure desire to have uh some rate changes you know move instead of implementing rates at peak times of usage maybe as such as july implement them on you know change the time of it to implement it uh maybe in a shoulder month like uh like may or something um and move to annual reconciliations as opposed to uh semi annual so this this would um you know there's there's delays this could have uh effectively this is a cash flow uh item and it could have an impact on our our our deferrals um that that we have in place there but you know i think it generally is consistent with the desire as we said to move off of these peak periods for making rate changes in the shoulder periods and um see what we built from there but we're we're we're actively reviewing that last night and today and we will be and have any comments that we would have to do as i said on the twelfth okay um there there was one part of it that would reduce the the carrying charges um from the uh the from whack to a prime rate on a variety of reconciliation mechanisms um is there any um do we have any i know this is all depressed and everything but do we have any sort of forecast as to what the um those reconciliation mechanisms like how much capital might be tied up in those uh no that you did uh that that is a point to um the uh um the caring costs that that prime which is consistent in some of the jurisdictions i guess so um no that it's not a significant um you know item but um it it's certainly one that uh pure had put out there in the that is to uh recover the deferred balances with uh with applying prime rate um versus a a lack okay uh and then just um we we don't know who the president's gonna be at scenes um but if the was a change in administration um do you think that could have or not have maybe uh a significant impact on the d o e m permitting process with respect to offer when the um the the permanent process i mean when when we meet with uh with bone b of b o m you know the the uh the bureau of ocean energy management you know that people are active we're actively working we're actively having you know zoom meetings or teams calls or whatever uh the the the uh the uh video capabilities are that we're using but you know we're actively working that and i can assure you that the people in the agencies are working full speed regardless of um you know who's you know uh president or what the election results are but certainly it would be good to have um you know the result to the election i think we've all as a as a country um you know that uh the election results are something that we've all targeted out there and wherever you fall on the uh the political spectrum is good to have uh certainty and as opposed to uncertainty so i think we're all looking forward to what the final outcome is there so we can we can move forward okay and so so this is for my clarity the process of the poem is pretty much the the agency the sort of the of fact process that's going on really you don't see a significant change one way or the other it's it regardless of the outcome of the presidential election is is that the right understanding that yeah i'd say the work at the agencies is you is going on you know they're you know we've been meeting regularly going through uh questions uh we're working through uh the various state agency so no i i'd say that the work is continuing um at the at the as you say the the bureaucrat level okay awesome thanks so much all right you all thanks paul uh next question is from mike weinstein from <unk> good morning mike hey good morning okay all right good i hope you're uh i hope you're doing well hey uh uh maybe you could just give a quick two second update on uh what you think the outcome at first might be for uh transmission r and you know considering i don't know if the election outcome may has any effect on any of this uh accelerating an outcome um well mike that's a that's a very uh big crystal ball that you're asked so uh but again thanks and i hope you're doing well thanks for your question i you know it's um i wish i had a um you know a better answer than to say that um you know it's working its way through we we don't really have um a specific clarity as to um when might um you know come up with something on the new england before pending new england and certainly um impact of the election one way or the other what what that could have in terms of commissioners and that type of thing so um the only thing i know for certain is we're we're looking at uh our ten point five seven uh rates and uh reserving to that level and an eleven point seven four cap um and you know we'll just have to wait and see what the finals the final outcome we'll we'll look at but i don't really have a um an answer i know in in years past when i've tried what i've tried to think that one was coming or it was going a certain way it really hadn't hasn't materialized so i think it's best a way for the the final the final order comes out at this point on order as it is it maybe right and uh a bigger crystal ball question uh would be uh you know i know that hydrocobec has a pretty big long-term control plan for you know hydro generation up there and i know that their long-term plans included lots and lots of northern past type transmission lines uh you know do you think there's ever a time at some point where there might be another uh another whack or another go at transmission at some point you know the transmission project i think a lot of that is dependent upon what the states want to get right so this this these are gonna be processes now that are driven by states clean energy paul season the state's desire to um um have uh either offshore wind or solar or hydro in the mix so um you know there are certainly there's a lot of activity at the states now i mean the states in our area all want uh aggressive uh um carbon reduction target so we wouldn't be asked the question to see a state you know want to um you know contract for more of that but there's nothing uh there's nothing planned on our end there's nothing that i see at this stage on the state's agenda that would would say that but when you say the word ever you know that's a long time right it seems like they also win program really is kind of uh planted that uh at least for the time being yeah i'd say that's a that's a good way of looking at it okay great uh thank you very much okay thanks mike uh our next question is from sue kim from goldman sachs good morning sue good morning guys um my only question is and i apologize if i miss this but could you give just an update on the uh connecticut grid mock filings and uh any updates on expected decisions from the commission and you know timing up investments et cetera uh thanks for your question and i hope you and your family are doing well um you you didn't miss it i um i mentioned um uh you know in terms of what items could be additive to our five to seven percent core business uh growth rate i alluded to uh <unk> uh in connecticut or new hampshire or uh potentially additional ami uh of uh dockets in massachusetts but uh there's really been no change that we uh all the parties filed comments and plans back in july and certainly you can understand there's been a lot there's been a lot going on and and i i think i may have said sis was in october but we all know that sis was in august um so since august uh there's been a lot of uh you know there's been a lot of focus on on on the storms and there's been a lot of dockets and as somebody else mentioned that we have dockets going on in terms of um uh moratoriums and whatnot so this you know the expectation was there was going to be another uh sort of go around um in another process in connecticut towards the end of the year i really haven't seen anything that would indicate a specific schedule um you know on that so i guess our best guess is still you know it's still in the in the pipeline and you may see more activity on on grid line they're in connecticut as we move over the next several months but in terms of being in our forecast um you know i want to be clear that there is currently no uh you know zero there's no grid bond um spending in our capital forecast uh for any you know grid bond programs that haven't been approved like in connecticut or new hampshire so so you know once they are approved and once we see what what our role would be in them um and once we see what that you know looks like then we have more confident in putting in the plan so that could be something we have information on by the time we get to the february uh update so um you know i'll have to stay tuned on that it makes sense uh that's all i had thank you guys and stay safe thank you what you do thanks and sue next question is from david <unk> from morgan stanley morning david good morning hi jeff <unk> thanks so much for taking my question um thanks hanny uh quick call quick follow up on offshore when you know in light of some of the recent delays i was wondering if that changes how you're strategizing around other bids that you're putting into future um rfps uh like baking in more contingency anything that might give a a greater level of comfort around the economics of future projects that you might win uh thank you very common and i hope you and family are doing well um certainly um every piece of information and that you get you know and this isn't just offshore wind you know this is you know on on our business but i'll focus on offshore winds that's the question you know every every month it goes by every quarter that goes by we gain more insight and information about uh construction about um you know uh rates about about you know lots of fact is if all of those things all of those things are factored into subsequent bids so the information that we have available to us you know as we're moving into a bid uh recent bid in new york is different than we had from bids that we made you know in rhode island or connecticut or massachusetts so every every data point is important to us and we factor that into the next bid so i i'd say that absolutely that um schedules and how you make it through the fighting process and all of that uh informs um you know subsequent bids and um so i can assure you that all those things get get you know up to the minute uh attention before we goes in okay got it um that's helpful and i just wanted to touch on um just o and m costs and the o and m budget could you remind us um how you see that trajectory uh just for the overall business going forward and you've got a great track record of controlling o and m um so what are the key levers um in your uh in your tool belt fill that that you would focus on going forward for managing o m um so there's a you know we've we've got uh people process and technology right so all those things our um our leverage to help you know our capital program as well as our our operating program so um you know we continue to uh implement uh systems and technology that um improve processes that makes it more affect you know efficient and effective workforce so we have um uh you know still a robust i'd say series of uh technology improvements um in if you if you uh i'll start off by just sending the space in the guidance we gave we said that we expected o and m cost to be you know down this year and then just for the forecast period kind of uh flat uh going going full it so how how are we able to do that um it is by some of these technology changes and we've been implementing more productivity management tools and tools for our you know individual line workers and gas in the field to get their work to update their um work that we can then take that and automatically update drawings and files we don't need you know to hand it off to somebody and so there's still um these productivity uh technology changes that are happening some went in last year some going in this year and and more uh plan for next so that that will be i'd say the lever the under the uh the underpinning for us to have the ability to continue to improve processes and and take um uh unneeded cost out of the business okay great that's helpful thanks so much for the caller you're welcome thank you david uh next question is from travis miller from morning star good morning travis good morning thank you a quick clarification on the storm cost but two hundred seventy five million number if i heard you correctly how much did you expense in the quarter and how much was either deferred or capitalized or will be pending that uh the regulatory filing that you mentioned so that that amount that you uh uh repeated was a deferred that's how how much of uh storm costs that we deferred in uh for profitable uh storm east i s and that was across um all states but primarily uh in connecticut so that's our deferral that would be you know once the storm gets to a certain level it triggers a deferral so we um that that all is deferred storm cost right now in terms of there there are other storms certainly we had uh we had an active quarter for storms in general but there are other storms uh other than sis that did impact the quarter i mean our our storm costs were up you know about ten million dollars for the for the quarter that went through you know our o and m so you know for the quarter it's it's at that level and then the two seventy four or five that you mentioned is the is the deferred across the system okay great that's that's very helpful thank you and then uh quick follow up to the discussion on the connecticut legislation and there's some language in there as i understood it's about the general assembly having some uh review power there what's your thought in terms of the scope of what the general assembly separate from pure could do in terms of either taking back some earnings or rate changes stuff like that separate from what's going on in the pure well certainly the general assembly uh can enact legislation that it feels as appropriate in any matter so um you know i i you think specifically to the energy legislation that was enacted um recently in connecticut that most you know things um all were you know for the most part moved to pure you know so the the regulator so the the i guess i look at it as the legislation would provide the intent the framework the direction and then pure is the one who's going to be implementing you know they're gonna be the ones who evalue rate the performance based rates they'll they'll be the ones who uh initiate the storm um you know standards and things like that and and and look at um you know should be penalties or should be food you know penal and things like that so i think that effectively you know the the the general assembly can can certainly enact uh any and all legislation uh it feels um it should and and the way that this legislation seems to that have turned out was that the implementation of that legislation is in the hands of pure okay so the potential for any or the risk for any kind of callbacks would likely go through pure instead of going through the general assembly based on that kind of to get legislation that you talked about great yeah as i say you know the um pure the dockets are active in uh will be active over you know there's certain time um dates that the legislation has given pure so it would expect that pure will have um have the pen on this but again as i say you know legislation can always be an accident in any um in any area yep yep okay great i appreciate it all right thank you travis our next question is from andrew <unk> from scotia good morning andrew hey good morning uh thanks for squeezing me in um first question is uh with the two rate cases now completed can you remind us what subsidiaries might be next to file general rate cases you have plenty of regulatory items of course with red mode and other initiatives but for general rate cases um well according to um the requirements in connecticut uh connecticut could be uh an area that is required to file uh by the uh existing um uh framework that's there um and that would be something that would be sort of a you know next year sort of event but other than that um we're pretty much out of the right okay great then on offshore winds um can you just thinking uh sorry can you share your latest thinking on how big you're willing to let that business get you talked a lot about the opportunities that you're pursuing beyond the three existing projects any thinking as far as from an earnings mixed perspective if there's a limitation or would you will you plan to just bid bid bid and get as many projects as your leases also work well i wanna be clear on this because i think it's a very important point that um big big bit isn't that strategy our strategy is to have a financial discipline about growing that business and a way that provides appropriate levels of return that benefit our shareholders so just by winning the bid um you know doesn't doesn't do it it has to be we have to and we continue to maintain financial discipline in terms of the uh amounts that we did and the returns that that we're looking for so um as as long as the returns are at an appropriate level that um uh for that business it makes sense to uh make the bid in the bid and and and expand the business there um the what we've said is we are tracks the what we own off the coast of uh or what what we have access to in terms of lease areas you know we could do about four thousand at least four thousand megawatts of offshore wind so there's kind of a you know that's that's the maximum capability that we we have so it's not an an incident growth type of thing and um we had indicated that uh when leases were available that are not in our region that we were not interested in them so leases in our region like the ones were involved in are good like other lease areas you know that's that's not for us in other parts of the of the mid atlantic et cetera so it's a we're constrained by the lease area and um we're we are guided by the financial discipline to um on our bids and our returns got it that's really helpful i guess i should have said bid bid bid responsibly okay well that's uh i think so like i work with and i hope you say well i'm just saying all right andrew thank very much uh that sort of wraps up today um if you have any follow-up questions uh please give us a call or send us an email and we look forward to speaking and seeing many of you during the virtual eei conference next week and thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference thank you for participating and you may now disconnect thank you all right okay
