good morning everyone today i will cover two key topics first i will provide perspective on the performance of our third quarter as well as on december sales strengths and then i will provide visibility on the current fourth quarter as well as on our outlook for fiscal year twenty twenty one to begin it is important to know that our first first quarter runs through september october and november and consistent with last year the saturday of thanksgiving weekend was the last date of the period we believe strong results despite extensive and widely reported covid related headwind these included lower food traffic drinks shipping capacity constraints and much higher freight costs further during a challenging holiday period we strengthen our commercial plans to drive significant digital demand why remaining focus on delivering gross margin expansion positive comp sales growth was led by our core bed path and beyond honor which was up five percent it was fueled by exponential digital growth of ninety four percent which more than offset store declines of fourteen percent growth was healthy and broad base across five key destination categories which grew eleven percent and represented two thirds of revenue total enterprise comparable sales grew two percent also driven by strong digital comp growth up seventy seven percent as you'll hear from john in a few minutes covid related headwinds disproportionately impacted store selling our baby business during the quarter yet encouragingly we saw a return to growth in december following some key internet the strength of our digital growth has been powered by the investments we have made in only capability including focus curbside pickup and same day delivery which are all completely new this year bonus orders represented sixteen percent of total digital sales in the quarter these service offerings provide ease and convenience and allow us to further gain trust from our customers including the approximately seven million new online customers gained the year our digital capabilities are becoming a key driver of results net sales were two point six billion and expected reduction of five percent primarily due to the impact from banner that investors and the continuation of our bed bath and beyond stored network optimization initiative this has been a holiday season like no other as outlined by third party data sources including sensor and adobe analytics market wide black friday in store traffic was down by over fifty percent and online standing was up twenty two percent similarly for the six week holiday here market wide in store traffic sale between thirty four and thirty six percent we perform strongly against this reported trends during the competitive intense five day holiday sales period from tansky through cyber monday overall comp sales demand for our core us at bath and beyond banner was up double digits versus last year and deliver digital comp sales growth of approximately sixty nine percent more than our setting store comp sales decline of twenty four percent and during the six week holiday sales period from november sixteen to december twenty seventh our total enterprise comp sales grew low single digits let a significant digital growth of more than ninety percent which more than offset store comes sales declines of more than twenty percent i will now continue with our third quarter financial results on a gap that including the non-cash loss from banners divested for hell for sale we reported a net loss for diluted share of sixty one cents our gap results include approximately eighty six million from a favor impact which are excluded from adjusted results to provide better perspective on the underlying performance of our business this includes special items such as losses on the sales of businesses including cost plus world market which has helped itself as well and non-cash charges for the impairment of certain long lead assets plus restructuring and transformation expenses adjusted gross margin increased three hundred and ten basis points to thirty five point four percent this expansion was driven by a hundred and eighty basis points of favorable strategic engineering of promotion and markdown expense including data driven coupon optimization a hundred and twenty a basis points of favorable product mix from higher margin categories such as bedding and bath and two hundred and ten basis points of leverage from distribution of fulfillment costs this benefits were partially offset by a two hundred access points impact from channel mix due to the anticipated larger proportion of total sales from digital channels versus the prior year this impact also includes around eighty basis points from higher shipping expense associated with in street wide outbound great rate increases particularly in the latter part of the quarter the significant year over year improvement in our adjusted gross margin reflect the management team focus on driving the components of margin while delivering explanation growth in digital sgna expense declines forty one million versus the prior year driven primarily by lower payer related expenses including savings from our comprehensive restructuring actions earlier in the year adjusted but i increased a hundred and sixty eight percent to a hundred twenty one million which is almost three times higher than the prior year period this was driven by digital sales growth call with gross margin expansion once again these results demonstrate that our efforts to transform the business and build a modern durable business model are working turning now to some cash flow and balance sheet icon statements we are not two hundred and forty four million dollars in positive cashflow generation cashflow from investments was two hundred million dollars positive and sitting through the proceeds from non-core asset monetization net of capex operating cashflow of forty four million dollars was also positive in spider season of dynamics we continue to carefully manage working capital this quarter with ending inventories of one point eight billion on a sequential basis inventorys were thirteen percent lower versus the second quarter and thirty percent lower than last year this was primarily due to the need back from banner divestors including seasonal inventory purchases for the hard day seven period we are tracking at a faster pace to deliver our previously stated twenty twenty one goal of one billion dollars in inventory reduction at retail compared to twenty nineteen our capital expend during the quarter we're only thirty eight million that's it we have plans to significantly ramp up our cap expanding starting in fiscal twenty one in support of our digital first only always transformation during the third quarter we also improve our gross debt balance with a reduction in operating lease liability of about half a billion dollars from non-core banner divestors and store closures taken together with a half a billion in that reductions we achieved in the second quarter we have reduced total growth debt by about one billion dollars so far this year a reduction of about twenty five percent we remain in a strong net cash position with an ending cash and investment balance of one point five billion this is in line with the balance at the end of the second quarter even after returning cash to shareholders in the form of accelerated shared purchases we have i also maintained a strong liquidity of two point two billion dollars including our idea so capitalizing on this strong financial position we launched a two hundred and twenty five billion accelerated chair with purchase in late october and in december in conjunction with the announcement of a definitive agreement to divest cost plus world market we reported plans for a second asr in the amount of a hundred and fifty million these two programs totaling three hundred and seventy five million are expected to be completed on or before the end of our fiscal fourth quarter next month in february and we'll result in a reduction of our shares outstanding of approximately fifteen percent at current stock price levels our authorized level for sherry purchase at the early stage of the planning period is now up to eight hundred and twenty five million dollars over the next three years these actions reflect our balance to upper allocation principles strong liquidity and confidence in our strategic growth plan in summary our third quarter performance shows consistent execution of our strategies which drive sales and ebitda growth coupled with strong cashflow gen duration and the reunification of capital return to shareholders now moving on to our look i'll start with some directional caller on our expectation for q4 and then provide perspective on fiscal twenty twenty one it has been widely reported that covid nineteen related headway continue to impact the retail industry in this context we will not be providing specific sales and earned is guidance for the current fourth quarter that's it we feel positive about the parts of the business we can control and expect to deliver year and year adjusted even that margin improvement in q4 this despite your store traffic and shipping constraints accompanied by higher freight costs in terms of the top line comp sales are expected to be approximately lined with last year we expect consistent strength and digital to be tender by covid related headlines impacting stores december sales show positive total enterprise comparable growth including continued strength across key destination category importantly we're for a double digit on favorable impact on q4 total net sales versus last year even the divested banners and the ongoing store optimization initiative in terms of growth margin in spite of the anti data drags from significant freight cost increases in q4 we're driving cost optimization actions to manage the impact of these pressures so we expect growth margin to be about in line with the same period last year again we expect to deliver a year and year adjusted ebitda margin increase in q4 with absolute ebitda figures in line with the prior year now i'll turn to fiscal twenty twenty one our initial outlook included fiscal year twenty nineteen as the base year at the time our portfolio banner review was still underway we had already divested four banners but we did not have a signed you for cost plus world market yet now we do and we expect this transaction to close imminency today we're providing additional visibility on the significant shape of our pnl as a result of these factors and the closure of underperforming stores our significant portfolio transformation will lead to fewer better performing stores and will include a healthier core revenue base with a larger proportion of a faster growing digital business we're now tightening our projected fiscal twenty one revenue range to approximately eight to eight point two billion looking at quarters starting with the first quarter which will not be on a comp basis we expect to recapture the lost sales opportunities from the store closures in twenty twenty due to covid nineteen during quarters two through four which we will be on a comp basis we expect to sustain comparable sales levels in relation to the solid comp sales base of fiscal twenty twenty our sales forecast for financial planning purposes assumes total their price comparable sales to be in line with fiscal twenty twenty we are reiterating our expectations for adjusted gross margin of approximately thirty five percent which represents a more than two hundred basis point improvement for this is pro forma twenty nineteen we are enhancing adjusted fiscal year twenty twenty one ebitda to a range of between five hundred to five hundred and twenty five million this represents a twenty percent increase from the performer twenty nineteen ebitda base of four hundred and twenty five million the drivers of the adjusted ebitda range are consistent with the ones we have previously shared including cost saving from plan store closures product sourcing and restructuring actions and the impact from reinvestments and channel shift and shipping costs and as i said earlier we have assumed comp sales to be versus fiscal twenty twenty for modeling purposes as we're not requiring sales growth to deliver the higher ebitda range but needless to say we will strive for continued top line growth in a highly compared environment our performance to date gives us confidence in our longer term goal of achieving between eight hundred and fifty and one billion in adjusted ebitda by fiscal twenty twenty three importantly our portfolio transformation couple with store closures is driving significant balance sheet improvement through growth that reduction of one billion dollars this will result in a growth that we our ratio below three point five times which puts us well on our way to our midterm goal of below three times we have a strategic and disciplined pathway for driving sales and margin growth generating cash and investing in our business plan to drive shareholder value creation and it is working i will now turn the call over to <unk> chief digital officer thank you with covid as a headwind to our store traffic we have stepped up our strategy as an omni always retailer and it is paying off during the third quarter we delivered this growth of seventy seven percent our third consecutive quarter of growth in excess of seventy five percent this year our bed bath and beyond banner alone post digital comp sales up ninety four percent almost doubling last year sales with this momentum and based on current trends we are on track to exceed our digital sales call of three billion by the end of fiscal twenty twenty we have laid out a transformation plan to unlock the potential of our omni always growth strategy by elevating customer experience building out our omni capabilities and evolving to a digital first culture the goal of this initiative is to meet customer whatever they are i'm pleased to report that the company is now incredibly equipped to do that the benefits are coming through not only in digital sales growth but also in customer metrics the during the quarter we gained two point two million new online customers of which the bed banner alone added one point eight million year to date we have gained approximately seven million new online customers and not only our be attracting new customers we are seeing them return at a higher rate than ever before in the third quarter twenty one percent of our bed bath and beyond customers placed more than one online order compared to about fifteen percent versus last year so what's driving the sticky customer experience for online customers we believe the true hero for us is buy online pick up in store since introducing focus and contact less per of site pick-up services earlier this year we have seen a rapid rate of adoption by our customers in the third quarter approximately one point two million customers placed a bonus order representing sixteen percent of our total digital revenue in the back up and beyond banner focus orders represented thirty percent of total digital sales and seventeen percent of total digital orders and sixty percent of our focus orders are were ready within thirty minutes is surpassing our two hour promise this fast and convenient experience has earned bed bath and beyond a net promoter score of eighty percent for our both of services up from forty nine percent in may when we first interviewed the service our stores are now a competitive advantage of our omni strategy fulfilling a total of thirty six percent of all digital sales in the third quarter this muscle was not in place last year the now we're connecting our stores with our online platforms and the power of omni is enabling us to better serve our customers however they choose to shop we know omni channel is the future of retail and we are making the right investments that are resent with our customers the fast-based transformation of our digital offering and elevated customer experience has resulted in a twenty five percent lift in our online conversion rate for the third quarter as compared to the prior year key drivers of the increase include first the relaunch of our mobile sites and mobile apps we've implemented a new framework with an optimized experience that drove a thirty three percent increase in conversion and mobile sales growth of a hundred seven percent versus the prior year period during the five day holiday shopping period from thanksgiving to cyber monday our mobile home page loaded seventy four percent faster than the same period live we also relaunched bed bath and beyond and by by baby mobile apps resulting in over eight hundred thousand downloads this quarter our bed bath and beyond mobile app was launched over fifteen million times during this quarter and revenue more than doubled first last year we have also seen the rate of app uninstalled continued to improve further underscoring the stickiness of our customer experience second in order to ensure that we were firing and also lenders going into the holiday season we launched same day delivery on bed bath beyond dot com and buy by baby dot com to provide our customers another convenient and cost effective way to shop this service was interesting in q3 results are preliminary but we have seen hundreds of thousands of our customers take advantage of this new convenient way to shop we also began to offer same day delivery service through the launch of bed bath and beyond and by the of baby stores on shipped and instacart with both marketplaces each reaching more than eighty percent of us households harm and face values was recently added to the instacart marketplace and we are pleased with its initial launch

checkout process and be payment type options this includes buy now pay later options like after pay and paypal pay in four as well as extending apple pay from store only to our mobile apps during the quarter we also focus on optimizing our experiences and speak to place orders on our site making it even easier convenient and faster for our customers to shop with us again each of these initiatives were geared to customers with the goal of meeting them where they are in creating multiple options for payment and delivery as we look at our digital programs holistically is a true revolution from where we were a year ago and has become part of the fabric of how we operate at that back and the customer environment is rapidly changing and we are there to greet them at every turn through our enhanced services speed and focus on engagement our customer's perception continues to improve our army always strategies working and was a key driver of our third quarter sales performance our strength in digital has more than compensated for the headwind of the pandemic and as fast track our transformation as we moved into the important holiday season this year and sets us up for success moving forward we have delivered an elevated customer experience launch meaningful capabilities and pivoted digital from a lagger tactic to us strategic acid and a profitable growth engine that has delivered another strong quarter of growth with that i will turn the call over to john hartman our chief operating officer and president of bye-bye baby john thank you robbie we made exceptional progress across our operations in the third quarter specifically as it relates to our supply chain reformation optimizing our real estate portfolio in advancing our technology roadmap modernizing our business remains a key focus and we are evolving our store formats our distribution and fulfillment capabilities alongside leveraging our unique data and insights to meet the changing needs of our customers and deliver an exceptional shopping experience i'll start with supply chain while we remain focused on mid to long-term capability building we made very substantial pivots in the third quarter as robbie mentioned our stores fulfilled thirty six percent of total digital sales in the third quarter well last year we didn't have both this curbside pickup or same day delivery in our offering not only do these new capabilities provide ease and convenience to our customers they also help us to partially alleviate current shipping constraints and it additional cost pressures in the supply chain during the quarter we also added a secondary national carrier in several regional parcel delivery carriers which helped to offset an over twenty percent cost increase from our primary carrier set up and importantly we continue to focus intently on the health and safety of our associates working in our fulfillment centers by instituting daily covid cleaning procedures in our facilities concurrently we launched an evaluation of a number of potential third party logistics providers who will partner with us to establish new regional distribution centers and to manage the efficient flow of domestic distribution we anticipate that using third party logistics operators will also provide increased financial flexibility and reduced capital expenses this is the cornerstone of the transformation of our supply chain network and will increase our capacity for fast store replenishment while continuing to versus store network for omni fulfillment by making the replenishment process more efficient our store teams will have a more predictable and faster flow of the products we sell most in turn this will allow us to meet the increased to me for bonus curbside and same day delivery services while also reducing the time our store team spend managing deliveries so they can spend more time with our customers also core to our transformation is technology and we are taking a disciplined approach to our investments in building a technology infrastructure that will enable us to personalize the service for our customers improve our ability to predict and meet demand make it easier to collaborate across teams and drive down inefficiencies in our business over the next three years we plan to invest approximately two hundred fifty million to modernize the application and technology landscape to a cloud empowered foundation last quarter we talked about our expanded multi-year partnership with google and deloitte to enhance our omnichannel shopping experience this quarter we defined our plans for a new erp system we will also be pursuing a product life cycle management solution in support of our own brand initiative and an inventory management capability to improve inventory productivity these plans will all start in two thousand twenty one and our foundational parts of building out our technology infrastructure in other activity we are making significant progress towards the targets we have previously highlighted regarding our real estate portfolio including our store network optimization and store remodel plans let me start with our network optimization program which is designed to not only ensure our stores remain a strategic asset for us but also to ensure that we have them in the right locations to deliver more sustainable sales growth improved margins and greater cash generation as part of this work we are well underway in the process of closing approximately two hundred underperforming bed bath and beyond stores by the end of fiscal twenty twenty one initially we identified about one third of these stores to be closed by the end of the fiscal year we have since accelerated the pace of targeted store closing this year from seventy to about one twenty stores with certain stores closing earlier than planned due to having efficiently hold down store inventory during the closing process in the third quarter we closed four bed bath and beyond stores and in december we closed another seventy five and we are currently liquidating an additional forty two stores we are very pleased with our progress to date and completing a store closure program during fiscal twenty twenty one remains a priority turning to our bed bath and beyond store remodel program we have advanced from initial prototype phase to active iteration within ten stores in our houston markets these proof of concept stores highlight our destination categories bed bath kitchen and storage we expect to complete this phase of the remodel program by the end of february twenty twenty one additionally we will take all the visual signage and enhancements and immediately apply them to the entire fleet of stores on the same timeline next we will take our learnings from houston and move into our first expanded wave of renovations in twenty twenty one which includes approximately one hundred and fifty stores in total our store remodel plan involves two hundred fifty mill in dollars of investment over the next three years in touches over four hundred fifty stores representing roughly sixty percent of our revenue in addition we will utilize strategic sourcing methods to procure nasa remodel components at a lower cost and leverage economies of scale with this overall initiative instead of the legacy store by store one-off approach of the past we have established a unified planning process to identify prioritize and sequence all aspects of the remodel these story models and our network optimization plans are crucial steps in building an omni always organization that serves our digital first customers with an intuitive and modern shopping experience we look forward to reporting our progress along the way before closing let me provide some perspective on the quarterly performance of buy by baby which represents approximately ten percent of total enterprise reported sales in the third quarter this included strong growth in digital of approximately forty percent which represented more than half of the sales in the quarter it remains a challenging environment for our new or soon to be parents who are particularly vulnerable to the perceived challenges associated with in-store shopping due to covid nineteen as a result we saw a disproportionate level of store traffic declines from a baby customers this quarter then across our other banners these covid-related headwinds have also had a short-term impact on the registry component of our business which is highly correlated to in-store activity while we have seen overall growth in registry digital registry created online currently tend to carry a lower average value than those created in store enhancements to the digital registry experience are addressing this opportunity to assist our customers in building a more well-rounded baby wishlist covid headwinds have also constrained inventory levels in certain of our key categories such as furniture and gear as a result of disruption in the global supply chain we have made key pivots here including sharing improve forecast with our vendor partners well into two thousand and twenty one so as consumer behavior shifted we pivoted and leaned into this able to create an enhanced online experience with a more convenient suite of checkout options including afterpay pay in four and apple pay we also upgraded and relaunched our buy by baby app in november to strengthening the choices we offer our customers who connect with us digitally year to date we have gained nearly two million us online customers an increase of forty six percent over last year including more than a half a million new online customers in the third quarter in all nearly two thirds of our baby customers only shopped online this quarter as young parents take safety into consideration this year our new omni capabilities allowed us to meet them where they are at bonus curbside and same day delivery services digital orders fulfilled by our baby stores represented a significant portion of total orders in a quarter with bonus orders representing approximately half of all store of old orders while the holiday period is traditionally not a big baby season except for gift giving or needs of families getting ready for or just having had a baby we did see strong digital demand comp growth of forty nine percent year over year during the five day holiday period from thanksgiving to cyber monday this world was driven by top performing baby categories including toys playroom furniture and apparel these positives and category trends accelerated in december we believe in this business and we are now ready to double down on and significantly invest in expanding sales and margin and growing our market share we plan to accelerate our growth in baby over the next several years including introducing own brands aging up into toddler and younger children as well as expanding into categories like toys and educational as well as furniture enhancing our register and leading with new partnerships we will also invest to scale our footprint nationwide with about fifty new stores over the next three years fiscal two thousand twenty one will mark the true beginning of the transformation of this banner as we execute our three year plan and unlock the value of this brand earlier this week we announced the appointment of patty woo as senior vice president and general manager for bye-bye baby pat these exceptional experience will help accelerate our plans and drive meaningful change we look forward to sharing our progress in future conference calls mark i'll turn it back over to you now for closing remarks thank you john a strong performance this quarter across several key performance metrics including positive comp sales growth gross margin expansion positive cash flow generation and gross debt reduction is evidence of a a transformation taking whole even despite the significant headwinds of a global pandemic yet what i saw beyond the numbers was even more impressive our team was planning modifying and executing and aligned and disciplined like never before they were learning and improving in real time as the customer and conditions changed showing true agility emotion these newly acquired muscles extended from product and price through messaging and digital expression to sales floor and distribution center i'm truly grateful to all our associates that rallied around this call to action to demonstrate our strengths and opportunities as the new bed bath and beyond team and what has been an accept think we have changed so far we still continue to make bold pivots to reconstruct renovate and restore our company simply put we are delivering on what we said we would do we said we would put a team in place that would have the right talent next week to execute our new vision and inject new ideas and that we would create the right organizational structure to facilitate more streamlined decision making and we've done that we said we would lean into the digital space and make it easier and more convenient for our customer and it's a shop with us and we are doing that we said we reset our cost structure modernize for growth and refine our organization and we've done that and continue to focus on growth margin improvement we said we had a clear and a to establish our authority as to preferred omniternal home destination and that we would use customer inspired and market insights to develop our new customer value proposition and we are doing that we said we would evaluate our app set base and how best to optimize its value for the business on a go forward basis and we have done that and finally we said our mission is to ensure that better from beyond is well positioned for long-term success and we are doing just that i'm proud of what our teams have achieved and i thank them for their continued dedication and commitment to the long term success of our company our results is quite a set up firm base from which we will continue to drive our ball transformation and seek to are on our three year strategic and financial goals shared at our twenty twenty investor day we have many bowl and exciting plans for fiscal twenty twenty one such as launching your own brands that will help differentiate us in our key destinations a degree remodeling approximately a hundred fifty stores under our store network optimization program introducing new and unique digital services designed to enhance our omni always experience utilizing our technology operations and reinventing our supply chain for the future investing to further strengthen out by by baby and harm and better and continuing to unlock and deliver shareholder value in a year like no other we are embracing and driving transformative change staying curious and bold and so much more i'm proud of the commitment our teams have shown and what we have achieved together with that we will now take your questions you and now begin the question and answer session if you have a question please press star then one on your touch tone phone if you wish to be removed from the queue please press the pound sign or the hash key there'll be the labor for the first question is announced if using a speaker phone you may need to pick up the handset first before pressing the numbers once again if you have question press star then one on your touch tone phone and our first question is from renee from bank of america uh good morning thanks very much for taking my questions um yeah so the first one is um you know understand how you know very constrained shipping and freight was an issue for uh holiday margins but it how long do you think this pressure carries into twenty one it sounds like at least for the full year uh you don't think it's an issue since you're still targeting uh twenty i'm sorry um thirty five percent gross margins in twenty one and then just have a follow after that good morning thanks look uh we you know we know that the fight pressure you know across retail is here to stay and we've built that into our future plans uh so we see that our margin stability and the offsets that we created uh currently in the proof of concept of those over both q2 and q3 of this year um really stands in good stead to deliver that thirty five percent margin so we feel really comfortable around that okay um and maybe just uh you know again for you mark um you know maybe give this a quick update on you know some of the big merchandising initiatives you guys have outlined in october um analysts such as you know lower sourcing and vendor costs and then you know start to roll out improved and or merchant or more exclusive product and you know how much of an impact that'll make in twenty one or at least how to think about the cadence of those things uh you know in two thousand twenty one yeah i mean the good news is that we've already built off of foundation with these results you know the actions and trends we have here in terms of margin but across the board are really substantial and sustainable and they were going to add into those the rolling benefits as you outlet so the sourcing benefits that we've undertaken throughout twenty twenty are really going to be evidence in uh first quarter onwards twenty twenty one uh and then we begin in march with the rollout of our own brands and we're going to be sharing um more close in the imagination of that flow throughout the years several brands will be launched but the key news is that in the first half of twenty twenty one we'll be addressing the majority of our big key categories we're already seeing strength and growth in reinventing those with own brands and also the introduction of opening price point items and a range there which has been a huge missing part of our equation in terms of being truly competitive in the marketplace to build our authorities so these step changes um the the consist management of promotions um the mix management now we're going to lay in the incremental benefits of sourcing and own brand so we're excited about that progression in twenty twenty one our next question is from semi and morgan stanley good morning um thanks for taking my question can you talk about um where your expectations were a couple months ago for the fourth quarter in sales and now and and i know the outlook for next year in beds uh flatish um does that change now that you're gonna be laughing something that may be potentially weaker this year's fourth quarter yeah i think i mean i again we had robust plans for q4 of this year um we feel good about how we're executing on those but there's no doubt that the covid headwinds and the impact that that has had on foot traffic and uh overall consumer confidence it's something that we've had to factor into our plan since what we talked about the agility of our team through q3 and now q4 um to respond to those challenges and so we think we've met those in in uh you know what has been a turbulent time and we really look forward to laughing those next year in a very different way okay thanks for that and then my follow-up can you talk about um q4 you mentioned the freight headwinds but offset by some of the station um on i think the gross margin in terms of promotion and pricing can you talk about the promotional environment um and then you know thinking about um how much margin opportunity there still is i think for next years um it looks like it's more of a function of the margin changing as opposed to the top line just to confirm yeah i think that you know we would stress that we did not become more promotional during the quarter in q3 or in q4 we've actually reshaped and re-engineered our promotional activity we had opportunity to do so but that's really paying dividends in terms of generating gross margin and helping to create that balance and exceed of the equation on on the margin uh differentials from uh shipping and freight um so we're less promotional we're more focused on red price uh we're winning customers and we see that progressing forward as a <unk> outside a we're not putting pressure on the uh the working sales plan to generate our ebit uh we believe that we can do that through a number of the different initiatives we have uh through cost control and definitely margin growth in twenty twenty one as we outlined about three to a three year plan sorry and our next question is from bobby griffin from raymond james good morning buddy thanks for taking my questions i guess just to have a mark the first thing i wanted to talk about was you know looking at the range for next year it's a fairly tight range of five hundred to five hundred twenty five million you know it's still a lot of uncertainty out there so can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you see in the business now that really gives you confidence and tightening that range up and as a second part of that um where what what could be the driver that would cause that range to underperform is it sales is it margin what what gives you the most uh concern there hi bobby several here so definitely there's still a lot of certainties as we look forward but we feel very confident in our plans we have clarity on the drivers of gross margin expansion which is why we are reiterating a gross margin of thirty five percent may here in spite of the reason headwinds that we're seeing on freight costs as mark mentioned we're being more data driving and managing our promotion and our makes and with that we will offset it it is a type to range than the why the one we provided at investors day but we said that as we completed the portfolio work the monetization of non-core assets we would tighten that and that's what we're coming uh more to you right now on your question of what can throw us off it's not sales we are provenly assuming for financial planning purposes that we would have sales comp sales in line with prior year and each by with that we would deliver six if you can get that growth yeah maybe just i would just add that i think that the plan we're placing is a responsible plan based on changing circumstances in the market any threat or a concern would really be a macro market issue not an internally cost issue and again i think twenty twenty is exemplified uh how you know everyone gets affected by those things so we are monitoring things very carefully by weekend by quarter we feel at plant plants responsible and achievable uh i'm looking forward to delivering that all right thank you and i guess my second question would be for the december commentary you mentioned that the enterprise did show some growth for comparable sales but then i guess for the entire quarter you're you're kind of calling for flatish first last year or in line i believe is the rewarding can you maybe just talk a little bit about what is going in there is something popped up in the last couple weeks that's given you concern or is that just a little bit of you know function of being conservative given the level of uncertainty that's still out there in the world yeah bang on there um it's it's definitely around we've seen um positive signs in december remembering that our fourth quarter is december january february we're still have two four months to complete this process there's a lot going on in the world and we wanna make sure that we are being responsible in our planning and uh you know we look forward to kind of sharing more at the court court thank you very much best of what once again if you have a question press star then one on your touch tone phone and our next question is from chris hovers from jp morgan thanks good morning guys um so my first question is a follow-up as you think about you know you talked about you know things evolving and changing as you thought about um you know your your twenty one plan is it fair to say that uh covid changed in terms or the recent surge are you assuming that this sort of lasts longer until we actually get to a vaccine so was the change there and also was the other change uh the freight cost i mean presumably as the holiday the volume search are should come down as you get into a more normalized sort of shipping environment here so uh is there something structural within that freight that you're that you're assuming sticks around yeah i think that you i think it's prudent to think about an environment i mean we saw an acceleration a change of behavior between um you know our our q2 and september october results and versus our november results based on covid and based on foot traffic to stores customers being concerned around what the future held and real uncertainty in the market really began around the election period so we are big prudent in thinking through you know with the vaccine rollout it's still underway it's still very early we want to be able to monitor that and it's impact uh we haven't facted anything in terms of uh stimulus checks and their impact on the business because again that's been so uncertain as i mean just new news so just ensuring that the level of uncertainty and volatility that that has or could bring is built conservatively into our plans and that we can balance out any of those headwinds you know i think it's been interesting there's been a lot of discussion around the home category experiencing this great tailwind from uh you know the covid moment all of us in retail have been facing incredible headwinds and confusion and concern from the customer that we've had to face so i feel really positive that we are delivering positive comms profit every day in the face of that uncertainty and want to ensure that we've got a balanced plan going into twenty twenty one got it so to understood and then in terms of the fourth court i mean just relative to history for gross margin rate to be you know worse in the fourth quarter than it was in the third quarter just trying to really understand that you mentioned not being you know more promotional in december um is it uh you know you get about our math about a hundred forty dips from the accounting shift between costa goods and sgna so is a shipping search charger gonna be charged gonna be much large sure than the eighty basis points uh that you saw on three q you lap a hundred and eighty basis points uh of markdown pressure and obviously you know it seems like you have very clean inventory so just trying to understand the dynamic of you know sort of year over year and sequential basis and gross margins such that it would be flat in the fourth quarter year year sure chris um it's right on what you said about the shipping cost part of the reason you the preparing marks we talk about eighty basis points impacting q3 that was just the latter part of the quarter what we're estimating in q4 is over a hundred and fifty basis points impact and we're committed to offsetting that again through discipline promotion management and mix and that's what we will do but the incidents on the shipping costs it's much larger in q4 and that's why we're being put in on that great i just go ahead so cause i'll just also add if you're looking at q4 versus q4 last year the thing you've just scrolled recognizing that is a consumer behavior and the impact of digital purchasing versus store purchasing you know it is not likely like and it it's definitely accelerated uh and and that's brought with it um natural pressures to margin and mix as we've shared that we're offsetting that and mitigating that to be stable i think it was a real achievement so these are you know it's it is a q4 like no i and the consumer behavior the digital be that and therefore what that's meant for margin inclusive shipping is part of what we're balancing and again one month into our our three month quarter but we wanna make sure that we're being approved okay understood thanks so much guys and our next question is from peter benedict from there all right guys thanks uh thanks for taking the question um first i'm just curious on uh on the adoption of opus and i know it's been around six months and and you know the curbside but i mean how is that trending relative to expectations and and what um kind of what are your plans or goals to drive uh continued adoption of that um in the months ahead that's my first question yeah peter great question i i think what we've seen you know we showed an overall statistic for uh q3 but i'm packing that you see an escalation and a movement into the new muscle remembering we only interviewed this in may uh so what we're seeing now is we have an nps score of eighty you know we're able to provide about a two hour assurance on our order fulfillment still level and it's actually in real terms around thirty minutes customers are loving it i think in a total industry level focuses a muscle on a new uh methodology is very accepted by the customer and we are benefiting from that as well we saw our rates uh in the december period s the late week in week out as customers became more concerned around delivery shipping times and really ensuring that they had a joyous holiday period that they could secure the present under the tree and so we really went into um creating uh ease and coming to our customers that they really responded to and we're very grateful for we believe these are constants now and their muscles in the business that we wanna maintain and for us we know that a focus or fulfilled our store is almost equivalent to a store-based highlanders of profitability so the differential helps us and has helped us through two three and will help us in q4 in terms of our shipping and profitability costs uh so we think it's here to stay it is one of the sticky outcomes of not just the progression in focus but how covid has four to five this is a new muscle for most retailers okay thanks thanks for that mark and then i guess shift to you guys brought registry a couple times during your prepared remarks and um not sure how much you're willing to share quantitatively on on the size of those businesses but maybe these are more qualitative comments um baby versus wedding um and uh i mean you talked a little bit about basket size but just curious kind of how you how you see those to be businesses or that business across the two segments um as part of your outlook over the next couple of years any opportunities thanks yeah i it's a it's a great point i would actually differentiate between the moment in time experience versus the go forward experience and the moment in time it's experience as john outlined um baby registry is very strong for us but it has been more reliant on an in store experience and when we do that we build a bigger basket uh it's more sticky and and higher customer engagement and so we've been pivoting to st and our digital registry uh and we'll invest that further but for us we see complete upside in twenty twenty one uh with you know the return to a more normalized shopping environment in stores and digital in terms of true omni when we turned to bed bath and beyond the stories even better we are consistently uh at the top of the ranking and have held market share in most recent data in terms of registries uh now we haven't had the benefit of that in our twenty two or current numbers because of the covid moment and people are just not having wedding ceremonies in twenty twenty one there's gonna be pent up demand and transfer into into that year for weddings to occur and because we are number one in those spaces and well placed with held market share and the stats are good we feel like that as a runway for growth over the next couple of years is one of our sold strength that hasn't existed in our twenty twenty current numbers and we're going to doubling down investing area for further the next question is from steven forbes from guggenheim good morning so i wanted to focus on the trends within the categories maybe how side of the top five that you noted in the release um so so mark just curious how how these categories are performing um i know it's early but performing and within some of the new concept stores or remodels and or if you could just speak to some of the initiatives right that's it around addressing the performance here right cause although it's it's it's it's the lower percentage of sales it's still one third here so i'd love to see how how you're thinking about improving um you know those specific uh categories and yeah uh in the shared trajectory within them yeah thanks stephen it's a great question i think that there's been some natural uh headwinds there uh just based on some of these businesses being more relevant to sure-based traffic the digital traffic for us and one of them is personal care again um we in our remodel stores that we've been testing our personal care business is booming and actually showing a huge differential to our control and when we get the traffic we get the trade um and i think what we saw in in the end of q3 uh and and somewhat in q4 is this sort of suppression of foot traffic in stores that has a direct correlation and that's a business that either um is a great basket build business or is just part of a trip to store that's just not occurring at this moment as frequently it has in the past i think it's a couple of key areas to where uh we have had some uh some softness um i think cleaning is a really good example for us an area that's normally been wrong i think uh getting supplier product has been an issue um it's it's constrained across the globe uh and and we just haven't been a firing in that space um but at the same time we also cleared out of smaller categories like food um to kind of clean up our assortment that we build into that impact so we're really focused on doubling down our strength categories you see that coming through and consist consistent through q3 q4 and our efforts strategically in twenty twenty one the we are definitely focusing on a couple of key categories where we can really ramp up our inventory and our focus and we're already starting to see positive sides of that in january thanks just a quick follow-up uh you know if you were <unk> you know obviously we we know the minimum wage rate increases that are transpiring this year and um you know potential some pressure right from other retailers announcing uh you know the past the fifteen so curious you guys think about um you know that as a pressure point right on the business uh and and what's incorporated right in the financial guidance uh as it relates to wage investments for twenty twenty one yeah we definitely see the emerging trends in the the evolution uh we're looking at you know change of leadership and how that can impact on that no news on that today other than that we're looking at it very carefully uh i wanna be competitive in the marketplace and we'll be absorbing that into our overall cough and uh financial plans going forward thank you that's luck our next question is from carla casilla from jp morgan hi could you just give us an update on what how much of your cost savings did you achieve in the quarter from your overall goal yeah we're on track with the uh that uh the objective we have of two hundred to two hundred fifty million going next year we expect about a hundred twenty five uh at least in the current quarter we saw um savings as you saw in the building block right a hundred eighty basis points from product margin um and saving including leverage of distribution costs of two hundred ten basis points okay so we can count those is the cost savings program okay that's great yeah and also um um did you provide overall um same store sales at by by baby harmon i know you gave some details but i don't think i heard the same store sales number overall no we did not provide that card i mean historically for the third quarter no we haven't well we said in the remarks is um in the third quarter same source sales were down in bio baby and then recovered in december the reason why they were down then early in the quarter is some of the dynamics that john spoke about just keep in mind store sales store traffic particularly by by baby slow down significantly in november and it was partly compensated by the strength in digital um but still that recovery started happening in december okay great and if you're how much of your if you look at the bed bath and beyond business alone how much of that business was done by digital i know you talked about digital growth there but i'm wondering you gave it for the overall company but how is that training and bed bath and beyond versus last year we did share that that digital growth there is ninety four percent for the quarter college so exceptionally strong i guess i was wondering what percentage is the digital sales not the good that's that's kind of the overall company okay third thing it's about a third thing yeah i think that the reference point to the color is that were ninety percent last year so and that was a growth and growth of the prior year at sixteen said so you can see that exponential growth of remembering that only includes the november portion of holiday periods so and our next question is from like last or from ubs good morning thanks for taking my question mark you mentioned several times about the importance of driving in store traffic to the bed bath model whether it through the wedding registry or some of the personal care products and one of the long-lasting outcomes of this situation is that there's just gonna be a higher penetration of e-commerce in retail and some of the initiatives that you're rolling out like your side pick up and ship the ship to home are gonna drive less traffic to to your stores so how are you gonna balance that over the long run and generate some of your sales productivity initiative but we saw it yeah michael thanks for your question we saw uh when you know things started normalized in the middle of the year before the second wave came through we saw really great competence stores and the the omnichannel benefit of stores and digital really came together in a positive way um you know for us in our forward planning that we've provided for the three year plan we've actually shown um we've actually factored in a very high digital rate into that so that our financials remain stable uh but we see that the the driving to store piece really does come from an omnichannel environment i think there's a number of great retailers that are exemplifying this at the moment and a trip to the store whether it before <unk> or for a true trip um both generate a sense of so in your community as part of your network and part of your need lifestyle so we look forward to a more normalized base we think our stores will be ready when that come through with new visual merchandising your assortment new planning and in a fifty doors plus a completely new environment and what we've seen in those new environments is that when we provide that the differential to our control is very very strong and that we see sales growth so we are funded leaving stores we're investing in stores uh and then we think that our assortment our presentation and our our results will really help us in further that okay my my question is in the bridge that you provided for your gross margin for twenty twenty nineteen to twenty twenty one you talk about the the positive drivers of sourcing own brands better promotions and markdowns and coupons upset by some challenge different freight talks in that there's there's no real discussion around reinvestment in in price or other traffic driving initiatives and this is gonna be at a time where arguably i mean no this is debatable that some of the tailwinds at the home related category are gonna fade in a reopening environment yeah i i i think the reason why that's not in there is that work has been done i mean we're already showing that the industries on the of the eyes for our key categories that we are showing great everyday parity to our key comp set uh with our promotions that we are using now are taking hold and actually we are using them more effectively so we're seeing cost savings in the promotions they're getting much more effectiveness we've believed that these muscles which we've displayed in the last two quarters that have really driven great grass margin growth are sustainable area inside the mix i think that the the promotion of expectation of twenty twenty one i feel is overstated i think we see great data that shows that the home trend will be sticky this is part of people's lives now in their expectation of creating joy and comfort at home um and and we don't believe that there's going to be an exceptional chase into a promotional activity but our financials and our promotional cadence that we have and the balance we've created this year is ready for that in twenty twenty one and our last question is from seth <unk> from woodbridge securities thanks a lot and good morning my first question is just on your ebitda guidance for two thousand and twenty one could you give us some color as to what the impact from the banner sales uh specifically cost plus and and uh uh christmas tree shops in that forecast so the guidance we're providing in twenty twenty one is already on a core banner basis it is it only includes better by by baby decorous in harmon we showed in the bridge what would be the proforma uh twenty nineteen paul least those bands of messages and that's a starting point of four hundred and twenty five million dollars okay that's clean on that ongoing basis yes that's one of the things that we weren't able to do at the investor day and we share with many of you after was that uh we had to include in full uh cost plus world market business um in terms of the ebitda projection but we didn't include in the sales projections so what you see now with that sale is that's on a range being presented um based on the true pro pro form of twenty nineteen uh again still with that responsible attitude to even uh uh for the full year based on some of the early changes and up on the can occur but you know it was a second be a pivot that we can provide to be even more definitive on the way to further growth yeah and that's i know you know this but it's a tighter range on revenue now when you compare net sales twenty twenty one there's reported sales in twenty twenty or twenty nineteen it's not comparable that's why we want to provide the guidance on a comparable basis and we're gonna see some of that dynamic in q4 already while we've mentioned that q4 net sales are gonna be down double digits my recorded basis between fifteen up to twenty percent is simply the impact of the bandage divestors it's a significant transformation going on it's a totally different shape of the pnl uh next year on concepts on sales on stores understood my followup questions related to the mix of online versus in store sales that you're expecting in two thousand and twenty one when you expect that of in store sale to increase from two thousand and twenty and if so why do you expect so much channel shift headwinds is it just because of freight rate increases yeah i mean we do i mean there's a natural pivot back to stores they just will be uh you know and again it's been such an exceptional year uh we think that the digital penetration will um continue to be strong uh and we've got great offsets to that you know including where we were sharing that thirty six percent and of all digital loans were actually fulfilled by uh stores in the quarter was just an incredible agility there so we're gonna be offsetting some of the costs we see some freight permiting in twenty twenty one uh but we are factoring in the high digital penetration right thank you very much and that is all the time statement we have for questions i will now turn a call back over to janet barth for closing remarks thank you and thank you all for participating in our call today please feel free to contact me or felix with any additional questions have a great day and stay safe thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes today's call thank you for participating and you mean now this
