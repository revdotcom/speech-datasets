performance in the third quarter while as expected our outfitter business remain challenged as a result of the pandemic we continue to make great progress on the strategies we have a outlined while leveraging our strong foundation to advance our growth initiatives total revenue increased five point nine percent to three hundred sixty million compared to three hundred forty million last year momentum continued in our global e-commerce business which increase twenty percent with strong results in our us e-commerce business which grew approximately fourteen percent and our international e-commerce business with a fifty one percent increase for the quarter during the quarter we saw strength in a number of our categories including fleets sleepwear lounge wearing nets as well as in our home business with many consumers still working from home these categories delivered double digit growth in the quarter as our marketing strategies emphasize the comfort and value in our product assortments partially our setting the strong globally commerce group sales and our outfitter business were down twenty six percent due to ongoing pressure as a result of covid nineteen the outfitters results reflect overall sequential improvement versus last quarter although our travel related national accounts and our small and mid-sized businesses remain challenged the most significant improvement came in our school uniform business where sales were pre ultimately flat to last year for the quarter overall we expect performance in this business to remain choppy with a recent spike in the pandemic moving to our retail business sales decrease approximately forty four percent in the third quarter to million dollars this decrease was driven by lower traffic through the pandemic partially outset by improved conversion in our stores gross margin in the third quarter increased approximately ten basis points to forty five point four percent as compared last year gross margin benefited from our improved promotional strategies and continued use of analytics this was partially offset by higher shipping costs and third charges as well as sales mix from our growing third party business as a percentage of sales as gena improved by approximately two hundred thirty basis points to thirty seven point five percent compared to thirty nine point eight percent in the third quarter of last year this improvement as a result of increased sales combined with the continued discipline expense management across our entire business income tax expense was two point eight million compared to an expense of one point three million last year that income for the quarter was seven point two million or twenty two cents for share compared to that income of three point six million or eleven cents per share last year in addition to these gap measures adjusted even as an important profit building measure that we use to manage our business internally for a quarter of just ebitda was twenty eight point six million which is approximately a fifty two percent increase versus last year of just ebitda of eighteen point eight million during the balance sheet inventories at the end of the quarter were four hundred ninety nine eight million roughly flat to a year ago the strong sell through of our global ecommerce business has positioned us with healthy and lean inventories as we head into the holiday season inventory levels related to our outfitter business are elevated although this is not seasonal or fashion product so we expect to work through this merchandise as the business environment improves during the third quarter we secured a new term loan of two hundred seventy five million the loan proceeds combined with borrowings under the company's abl facility were used to refinance our prior term loan which was due in april of twenty twenty one upon the closing of the refinancing maximum available availability under the abl facility was expanded by seventy five million to two hundred and seventy five million the new term loan extends our declaration and further enhances our strong liquidity position with a more flexible balance sheet turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter we now expect net revenue to be between five hundred and five hundred twenty million driven by a global ecommerce business as a reminder last year's results include approximately forty million from our american arrow and launch after adjusting for the american airlines launch expected net revenue for the quarter would be between a two percent decrease and a two percent increase versus prior year we expect net income of thirteen point five to seventeen point five million and diluted errands for sarah to be between forty one and fifty three cents we expected jesse ebita to be in the range of thirty eight to forty three million and with that i'll help turn the call back over to rome to discuss the progress on our core growth strategies thanks jim despite

ability to navigate the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities as we drive growth in our business we look forward to updating you on our progress and future quarters and with that we open it up to questions thank you as a reminder to ask a question you would need to press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question please trust the our first question come from the line of alex furman with craig how long your line is not open great thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on a really strong quarter um you know we wanted to ask about what you've been seeing so far it sounds like the the unseasonably warm weather has you know had a little bit of an impact on your outerwear business um anything to call out you know now that we're just on the other side of thanksgiving weekend uh about you know how how your brands perform during during black friday and through cyber monday um any anything notable to call out there yeah alex thanks for the question uh i think like everybody else we're seeing a shift in consumer behavior this holidays season with obviously an emphasis on online shopping black friday itself was a positive day for us spoke domestically and internationally we saw solid growth in our business year over year and we're pretty encouraged by the continued resilience and performed of our globally commerce business but the fourth quarter got off to a slower start in the us particularly due to our heavy auto work category i don't like to bring up weather i always think weather's kind of a cheap excuse but i think as everybody knows cold weather has it really started yet and it'd be couple that with people staying home and indoors and not commuting because of covid the demand for heavy outer where it just isn't there yet but if you look at our other categories that you would expect or other categories are performing well same categories uh and third quarter going into the fourth quarter that people have had good demands for great that's that's really helpful thanks and then um you know it sounds like you guys are acquiring a lot of new customers here or at least in the in the third quarter um where has that been coming from is there been any you know particular marketing channel that that's been effective or or new products that have been bringing new customers in or has that just been kind of a continuation of of the efforts that you've been putting in place for a while now it's a bit of a mix i mean obviously search has always been you know the the line share of where we have new customers coming in from a marketing standpoint but what we've seen is that a couple of other areas are performing super well for us uh even though we put smaller dollars into social media has been doing really well and uh we've got some video out on connected tv which seems to be doing a pretty good job for us couple that with you know big increases in knitwear lounge wear active wear which is bringing in a lot of newer customers for us and those customers tend to be on the younger side from where our existing customer base is so that looks pretty good for us great that's that's helpful um and then you know lastly if i could just ask you know on the outfitter side of the business i mean obviously that's that's pretty uh you know closely impacted by the pandemic um just curious i mean you work with a lot of the biggest um companies out there in retail and transportation i mean what what's the outlook for next year i mean at what point do you think um things are gonna start turning around for for some of your big customers i think that uh what you're going to see is a longer callback in any of the travel related product uh anybody's really related to travel right now they're seeing in increases all the small increases i think where we're really gonna be concentrating in the outfitters business is going to be on the small and mid-sized businesses and making their customer experience easier we think that there's a big opportunity for us to improve the customer experience uh online of getting your product logo or getting your product uh customized in multiple ways and making that an easier uh and easier customer experience and we're gonna see a lot of content creation in that part of the business you know alex i i think you touched on on that as far as the outfitters it's really three different businesses if you remember it's about one third school one third small and mid-sized business and one there's a large national accounts so drone ninety the large national accounts is probably gonna be the slowest recovery we were very excited to see the the sequential improvement that we mentioned in the school business and that business was actually fairly flat for the quarter that's great well thank thank very much uh both of you thank you our next question come from the line of steve morata with c l king and associates your line is now open good morning drone and jim congratulations on the third quarter as well as far as drums you just touched on it as it relates to staying at home or outerwear assuming we get a relatively normal winter season from this moment and forward could there still be a negative impact on that category just because people aren't going out as much and if so how do you quantify that i think steve from what we put out with guidance we've taken it into account for what we think will be happening over the course of the next uh the next few months you know as you know the cold weather is really in front of us uh not behind us based upon the date so far so um i think we've taken it into account and the guidance you yeah i think as far as a qualification steve to drone's point it's in the guidance i think the other thing we feel really good about and we mentioned this because we had such a healthy backend of the second quarter and the third quarter our inventory positions are so healthy so lean that even we might have a little bit of challenging some of the heavy outer where you know we we don't think there's a lasting impact there gotcha and do you come in international commerce was up really really well can you come in on the tactics that help that what is that as percent of sales right now and how can you capitalize on that segment of the business going forward i think a lot of things that i work in there internationally are a lot of the things that that that you hear us doing on the us side um so so many of those things we've been doing for the last several quarters there from what we've been doing from a digital perspective from what we've been doing from a data analytics perspective from a what we've been doing with capturing new customers we're now rolling many of those things out especially in europe and we've really seen significant positive impacts there and how big a percent of the sales was that in the third quarter and i i don't think we give that as a specific number um but but i think you can go back to history and and do some of the math obviously continues to grow the overall globally commerce business is now probably up over eighty percent as a percent of our total with some of the challenges and for the business and that continued growth and you know on the e-commerce side gotcha okay very helpful thank you i'll take the rest of my questions offline thank you thanks steve thank you that i know further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect
