please stand by good morning and welcome everyone to convince the second quarter twenty twenty financial results conference call please note today's call is being recorded all lines have been placed on you to prevent any background no after the presentation there will be a question and answer session during this conference call management may discuss certain forward looking statements concerning sense of future performance and should be considered as good faith estimates made by the company these four are looking statements reflect management expectations are based upon currently available data actual results are subject to future events and uncertainties which can materially impact the company's actual performance at this time i would now like to turn the conference over to edward <unk> <unk> chief executive officer please go ahead sir good morning everyone i will go to <unk> second quarter two thousand twenty results conference call i think it's customer one <unk> yeah two hours on the line and today was was joined by <unk> we hope that you and your loved ones are in healthy and safe the second quarter was the most challenging period we have pays operationally in many decades although they are differences in performance and among our business units but also we saw severe impacts from coming continuing the lack of consumer mobility in the job of this research that translated into solve performance for most of our activities and consumer locations and the challenge was compounded by the lack of view supply that only began to recover in the month of doing i would help the vision fair better as the man for his production products remain high hotels were constrained by strict restrictions in post and consumers and the ability to move around particularly in our south american market the field division was impacted most as we could utilization felt quickly and drastically however from a deeper valley and error in terms it is a referral patient that it seems to be rebounding faster for in part for a quant offensive was quite the student everything institution capabilities to one again adapt to consumer needs and minimize the negative impact of the long term having said all that i would think continues to execute at a high level in very complex environment and we continue to focus on the safety and health of our people and with customers above all else moving on to the skull centers consolidated quarterly numbers total revenue during the second water decreased ten point seven percent while income for operations decreased thirty seven point percent on organic basis total revenue decreased fourteen three percent and income from operation decreased by forty point four percent for this quarter the difference between reported and organic figures reflects to most of our drug stores in ecuador a full quarter of the agb operation uh in brasfield and forty five days of the waxy and north american general distribution platforms acquired in the united states income decrease significantly driven by number one lower income for operations as i just described number two higher other non-operating expenses including severity charges related to the extraordinary payment of almost eight point eight billion persons agree with the mexican tax authority as well as impairments including for certain assets of <unk> and the closure of these operations and number three terms of participation in <unk> which were lower relative to the comparable figure we reported last year in terms of our consolidated net that position during the first quarter it increased by approximately ten billion vessels compared to the previous squarter to reach a level of seventy two billion presence at the end of june the effects have been invested in approximately nine hundred million dollars in the work in north american platforms as well as the majority of the large box payments measure on the for while we are on the adults and the soldiers of bet we should mention that during the quarter would place seven hundred million dollars in the second reopening over thirty years daughter denominated bond issues bringing the total amount to two point five billion dollars which was our original target the way that ever healed for the potent insurance was two point five percent which was also our target back in september when we started with this project and i highlight this because it took us nine months and we went to the market on three separate locations in order to get the amount we wanted at the cost we wanted we were very patient and it paid off and this is the approach and and this is approach and this treatment where we try to bring more financial decisions moving on to discuss our operations at the beginning with ventures commercial opportunity division we should start with a comment about store things while we manage to often a number a new stories in the quarter we also have to close a small percentage of our store base due to covid nineteen risk victims and effects some of the closures will be temporary for some will depend as we take this opportunity to remove certain marketing stores from our base the numbers for the quarter went like this a hundred fifty nine new openings eighty five opening up to remodeling and maintenance to four definite closures and two hundred sixty and priority closures as a result we recorded a net result in the forty stores for the second quarter to reach a hundred fifty net store openings for the last two months in addition to the store closure we've reviewed the number of operating shifts from three to two in a large percentage of our stores as twenty four seven operations is not viable or necessarily giving the consumer dynamics also seems to the sales were now twelve point four percent for the second quarter reflecting a twenty four point twenty four point one percent decline in store traffic and increased the fifteen point four percent in average customer ticket here it is also useful to post and discuss a little bit what happened with enter water because we did see meaningful differences as the quarter went by during april as you may recall we have relatives availability of beer to the most of the month as well as some funding buying for certain activities and the part of consumers and these indicators the blow and made april the next month of the quarter for also during may however we basically deployed our beer inventories and we saw these stickers contractions in traffic making the worst month of the quarter finally in june we began to record a beta availability and we also began to absurd a grab wall shift the consumer dynamics you know the first part of the quarter most of the consumer demand weakness came from ability restrictions and lockdowns with the first and creating location suffering from the absence of customers going about on the street and the gathering location reading from social distancing however relating the quarter of the weakness in demand in demand seems to be driven increasingly by economic hardship so many consumers have lost their income making the crisis today a bit more similar to prior downstairs but also more pronounced adding to the headwinds as much as half of our stores in mexico where there's some type of operating restriction from local authorities to in the quarter altered related to the sale of alcohol in a certain time windows respect most of the restrictions to be temporary moving down the income statement for the second quarter gross margin for talked about ten basis points reflecting negative salesmates affect caused by the beer shortage in may and then two performance of our daily and replenishment categories partially offset by a high single business increase of our services capability income preparation decreased almost sixty six percent and operating margin contracting to a hundred twenty basis points reflecting significant operating that we leverage moving on to francisco after health division reviews our store comes by seven drug stores the amount of temporary closures was enough to set it's not number of stores we opened doing the water i didn't say that we have a total of two hundred two thousand one hundred million and open units across our territory at the end of june and what a hundred twenty eight total net new stores for the last two months learning is increased to port focus it was on and again basis they decrease nine point one percent since to ourselves decrease an average of nine point eight percent in mexican vessels reflecting the negative impact of the street mobility restrictions implemented in our south american markets including is partially upset by assertive performance in operations in mexico world margin expanded by eighty basis points in the quarter reflecting number one a positive sales mix affect driven by consumer behaviors it's in connection to the pandemic number two more effective collaboration with key supply partners in our operations in south america and number three better margin performance in our business in the color we are applying circle forest operations as practices is very very improved operating martin contracted one hundred twenty basis points reflecting lower operating leverage in south america as we anticipated last quarter and sacramento skills the vision was this most exposed to the current environment of loved ones and reviews will be gained and the impacted digital in our quarterly results while we were able to add one new let one new agent or limited work same patient sales decrease an average of almost fifty percent in the second quarter was margin reach thirteen point three percent the operating margin was point one point eight percent of total values reflect in considerable operating the leverage operating expenses decreased fifty percent as a sort of type expense control and increased efficiencies as a figure lining in terms it seems the business is the one that is recovering more quickly the interesting terms showing the sequential the two many interesting weeks but driving from a very from a deeper contraction finally moving on if we to <unk> as john highlighted yesterday the results showed the city important performance in mexico improvement improvements in the field and columbia and continue the strength in bottom line they made for the purpose in developed and digital and only general initiatives in team markets and manage to deliver sorry for flexibility in mexico central america even in the context of the current pandemic from what we tell you can listen to the what kind of a quality conference call looking ahead or certainly remains high and it is hard to make predictions however as i mentioned before it seems the crisis it does really bullying in the beginning its main drivers were severe health concerns and the lack of concern mobility and this remain a problem however we're inclusively seeing the signs of another set of more traditional economic headwinds coming to play this is not possible but at least we have more experience with economy downturns as you might imagine we continue to look for our entire business in an effort to optimize it for the changes taking place today and for those that seem to be on the way and and for those that seem to be on the way and we will continue to work hard to go our company to meet the moment and to come out in better shape on the other side and with that we can open the call for questions operator thank you the question and answer session will begin at this time if you'd like to ask a question during this time simply press the star the number one on your telephone keypad if you would like to withdraw your question press the pound star two your question will be taken in the order that is received in the interest of time we ask this please limit yourself to one question at a time to allow the maximum number of callers to ask their questions again that is start one to ask a question and we'll go first to <unk> okay good morning uh thank you very much for taking the questions hope you have you're all safe and sound and <unk> and um well okay you're welcome welcome on board so um my my one question would be on the more recent uh performance in oxon you've elaborated how it went through the quarter but if you could shed a little light on the current performance of the most recent weeks into july where we've seen more states going into the orange face uh some of the reopenings and if you could also share with us on the uh temporary store closures um how many you you currently still have closed and how do you think the reopen it's going to evolve considering some of the tourist restrictions as well as office restrictions that has gone in place that will be my perspective uh thank you again uh let me tell you we we are making progress uh at the percent the quarter fifty percent have uh restrictions now i would say thirty five percent have restrictions the uh same sort of sales have improved a little bit uh mobility is is it's coming still but there's still um uh if we you know if we uh we just pay attention yesterday to the google mobility index and and the google mobility index in mexico is down around forty percent and and that really i mean that also really lives by that people are on the go and moving and and and this is really uh being the major cost we think that people are beginning to understand and and adapt to these new environment mobility is coming up new by little and and and not only current mobility but production mobility too and i think it depends that uh how why is it gonna happen with school system the next uh uh quarter uh what's gonna happen with with uh offices opening or keeping it closed so i think what's to me speak in the way that we are understanding the pandemic better um you know i child that the uh lack of contagious uh um um um of these uh pandemic in the stores is very low very very low basically the the problem that we have had with the the uh the uh our a personnel is more because the the lockdowns that live in their house and the lack of of of of of care they have with with connection with some family members and and most of the people that have had the pandemic go through the house not really from from from the traffic to the to the work of the store so we are optimistic but the thing is that they know we're filling now the pain that the economic downturn is becoming is is is staying here and and and and we are we we we are adopting the the offerings too but we are culturally optimistic yep that's what we have to be well thank you very much our next question will come from bob ford of bank of america okay thank you so much everybody and thank you for particularly my question is what about in your opening comments you mentioned the point foreclosures and that was it's really for a wider assessment of the store base and how do you think about the footprint right now in terms of maybe reallocating those resources to other locations or or maybe just uh truly an anticipation of uh of the more traditional headlines in terms of the the slow down in the economy well as i said the a lot of the long terms that we have had the restrictions of alcoholic um curfews or or lockdowns or the placebo open stores in certain commercial areas and and uh that was the number that we had around fifty percent have these kind of restrictions i said that now uh out of the nineteen thousand stores they are around seven thousand that might they have had some kind of restrictions for instance in the state of <unk> the people we can we were not allowed to to to sell we have to we have to close not only not sell alcohol but to close the completely the story and again i think local authorities are trying to best the best well that and and and and have come to measures against this pandemic some are effective and some are not uh i would say and and and but the thing is we try to to lobby and and understand what those urges are trying to do and help them to accomplish the objectives not necessarily by by by um start rising the way we we work with the stores um i think another problem is really through the low bound the lack of social mobility and the social distancing night shifts are very very weak um and and we have had some uh besides the the lockdown restrictions that we're gonna have some authorities or selling alcohol in some some stores also we are really closing some of the night shifts because again there is no no no consumers around so but again we think that will be temporary and um and we are adapting the best we can it's very much thank you and again as a reminder that is star one to ask a question and if you find that your question has been answered you can remove yourself from the cue by pressing star two we will now go to <unk> of gpm hi good morning everyone for the price for the question considering the timing of this crisis that came right after you bought or invested in a couple of companies which of them would you say that has had the most chat you start now in the sense of direction uh you know we we are very happy with the uh with our partners and when with the companies we require uh they're under <unk> and business and as as you imagine <unk> has uh have uh uh a a a a great uh uh demand for for the products out of the two uh watches more focused to jenson and north american have a more diverse platform and in fact north american has had to sell uh to some uh hospitality uh uh customers and i think probably that is the one that has suffered the most but i think both companies have adapted tremendously to this environment they need to to protect their their their employees and and and and but at the very same time try to serve the customers so we're extremely happy with them we have great partners and i think that uh we are going to build a a straight platform with the help of them and and uh we look forward with a very optimistic uh uh uh future i i think i would add um uh again which is quite um even on the on the jet a restaurant depot which is also one of the recent investments uh which being as exposed as they are to the restaurant sector uh one would think or at least one would've thought a few months ago uh that this would be a complicated period for them and i'm not saying it hasn't in complicated but certainly uh they have been uh adjusting and navigating the situation uh quite frankly exceeding exceeding at least my personal expectations uh which uh kind of confirms our view that this is a very well positioned and very well one company so they have been doing uh as i said better than better than expected adjusting and i think their customers as well uh the little restaurants adapting to you know curbside delivery um and things begin to open up in many of the markets that they serve so overall i would say on the restaurant depo front um you know positive surprise great thank you and now we will take a question from <unk> of credit right so if you could check your mute function we're unable to hear you hi uh are you listening to now yes please go ahead with your file yes okay okay hi <unk> hi <unk> hope you are well uh just two quick call questions here from my side the first one is about dna uh i saw that uh basically your dna uh increase it across the business division so just to understand what's driving such increase and secondly very brief uh if you can give you some your impressions about the maximum potential reform in terms of potential impacts for for fencing thank you very much well i i will go to the second one and i think uh uh net one answer the first one the the patient the former i think is if um this whole was there and i think it's a good thing that we all together tried to solve it because it would be uh very difficult for the common room to solve and and what we wouldn't like to have to solve it in a desperate way and and that that could disrupt the economic environment in mexico i think what we have for the future is it's it's kind of painful but i think it's what the right thing to do and i think between the uh um uh the uh uh private companies and the government i think it's it's it's a good friend that we are together here to to fix the whole for the long run uh and the other one uh one where did you go and try plans with the very first question please yes hi <unk> so we we are having uh some uh ammoization of it investments uh i think on the oxford front they have continued to to uh invest in their new version of some of the software uh as well as developing the digital platforms across the board um we have had some uh closures of stores uh and we've had some uh asset write downs both at <unk> and and at so i think that would be playing a part on that obviously we can we can also follow up offline in terms of you know making the numbers match but i think of the top of our heads that those are concepts that come to mind okay thank you thank you very much guys thank you and next we will go to gustavo <unk> of ubs hi good morning everyone thank you thank you for taking my question it's on oxo uh gross margin you mentioned that uh your your numbers are actually very good uh there was a very little contraction there you mentioned that the beer shortage obviously affected profitability but that was offset by about the service category on the recovery uh do you think that you could actually see an extension of gross margin as the i don't know if the service category uh we remain strong uh and the beer clearly could recover uh could you please elaborate a bit on on the train for for the gross gross margin for for axon well let me give you your supplies and us are concerned with the uh the lack of consumer uh uh uh economics time uh what we're trying to do is is to come up with with different offerings to to really just to make them demand um and here we are we have our our suppliers and our partners and trying to do something uh great for them for the consumer in in in in in including times but i don't know when where do you go and and go for the uh detail of the numbers piece sure um i i think on the gross margin i mean historically or you for for a long time now the two main drivers of gross margin expansion have been the financial services category and uh you know the commercial income that we that we receive from our from our supplier partners right now i said you know i think a positive surprise has been the resilience and even the you know uh faster growth of financial services during the downturn um as consumers have kind of made sure that they're keeping current with their with their memberships and their utilities and and um you know realizing or taking advantage of the fact that it's it's a lot easier to go to also than than to go to the bank and it can time consuming and so even though financial services had been contracting or at least it had been growing less in recent quarters in the last two or three quarters uh this quarter it actually uh the growth came came in in the high single digit which was a positive of surprise and i think contributes to the to the high growth margin the other question on commercial income is a little bit tricky uh because you know some of those agreements i said well i've also referred to um are are tied to volume and so it's hard to predict i mean we we do need uh volumes to come up uh transactions to go up for commercial income to go up uh you know consequence so i would say disability for both margin is is not as clear as we would like um i wouldn't necessarily predict at this point that we will continue to expand it um you know more than more than trend uh but at least during the during the second quarter uh it did kind of hold its own thank you i think it's very good thank you thank you uh i will also ask that probably the um uh they were a small increase also in in in uh the lack of beer also uh ship demand to uh to some other alcoholic beverages and um that those uh have uh uh that basically demanding a little bit too and that actually brings an interesting point uh a lot of it because you're obviously you're you're you're right uh consumers did uh shift to a higher consumption of spirits uh during the quarter um and interestingly i think what what the oxford uh our colleagues were observing in recent weeks was that even as the beer came back that the volume for spirit was still uh holding up strong so maybe you know in the effort to look for the for the silver lining or the glass half full um you know if consumers realize what the assortment and the the pricing is for for spirits uh at the ultra stores that this becomes a category that that is uh you know that is stronger than than historically because historically we haven't sold as much spirits as we are selling right now so hopefully this remains after the after the pandemic is is gone i we'll move on to our next question and that'll be from allen <unk> <unk> thank you so much good morning everyone that's great nope did we lose something else that we may have lost allen we'll go next to <unk> hi everyone thanks for the for the space for questions so here i wanted to to get your thoughts a little bit on on any potential uh product portfolio as an organization they're they're not so uh and maybe if you can share any any color on what you're seeing in terms of of the ship in in mix more recently now in july maybe going back a little bit more to the to the more profitable categories that you guys have there thank you you know unless we think that this black community will stay for a very long period of time um uh which we not we don't think it is the case i think we we back we have stood up better and we have stood up more to the um to the um um lack of of consumer economic uh to hour and and by by probably with a different assortment probably the uh looking for for cheaper or or less expensive problems um our returnable uh uh uh uh substance uh is is not as strong as we uh uh we should have it now and and and those kind of shits we can we can foresee it for the future but not necessarily in the types of uh of of of consumer demand of of of of first or or or um straight fast or people gathering depending on we think that eventually uh go those uh type of of consumer demand will stay it's more the lack of economic power the consumer that we're more concerned than than the uh real ship of of consumer locations that that's perfect that in a bit more on the on the short term kind of thinking now on on june july after the the bure categories back in et cetera uh do you have any any colors that you can share with us kind of there on on the ship back let's say in index yeah one yeah i i think you know one thing to kind of highlight and i think a lot of touched on it in his uh opening remarks was that um the quarter itself was a little bit of a uh i don't know if a v shape is a little bit of a strong uh descriptor but certainly the the the trough of the of the of the trend was was the month of may um and we believe that we hope and believe that we would mark the the lowest point of this downturn uh should be the one to me um and then as a beer comes back uh it it it helps everything right it helps operating leverage and it helps margins and uh generally begins to to turn this into a a more traditional downturn so so speak um and so you know the as i said a lot of this in the beginning we we are seeing improving improving metrics and improving uh traffic and and really the one concern i have is not to convey the view that you know once the the mobility restrictions are gone that we go back to normal immediately right because we are seeing this uh symptoms and and signs of uh of a more traditional economic driven uh downturn but uh again you know when you when you go dry and this has never happened before on the beer side uh obviously you have both of our suppliers on the beer front uh working hard to restock the the shelves um consumers themselves are are probably buying a little bit more beer than they normally do uh to make sure they don't go dry again and so you know you're seeing uh positive trends on on some of these uh important categories especially beer uh so i would expect that to to continue and you know we we will obviously make the adjustments uh a lot of the reference some in terms of packaging and and mix for some important categories um i think we need to to be careful and work hard to understanding how you know how quickly and and what the new normal eventually ends up looking like uh in the sense that we will i'm sure adapt our value proposition to that uh whether it means uh you know some incremental skus or shipped in the mix um and that sort of thing so so we're we're still not at the end of this uh but we know more about how the consumer uh adjusting habits then we did a couple months ago um and we are acting in in consequence perfect <unk> yes yes and we we'll now go back to ellen <unk> <unk> let's do this time words thank you so much thanks for taking my question and again good morning hope you guys are in your family conversation um and a lot of the fun um i just and we on the south side most of us have a buy rating on the stock i mean because of the of the evaluation of what's so implied here now the the result of this quarter i guess the question is uh this results put into question the business model of what's so in the long run this is the first quarter ever that you closed those uh so i guess the specific question is um what i'm sorry if i missed what what they expectations regarding store openings going forward and uh second thing and this is the question we get a lot of them i'm sure one also gets it a lot a lot of it's why they're reluctant to stay away from e-commerce um and that driving jokes with me saying every time you guys mentioned the complaints with amazon or so forth the stock reacts positively why not invest in a in a basement or in a second floor in in as many offices as possible to use them as distribution for e-commerce and leverage that especially giving the changes of the pandemic will cost and the third and last question you have to do with with capital deployment i mean i think that the pushback has been the ability in terms of capital deployment and what you mentioned about patients and discipline i think that's very clear for investors that you that are very patient but what can you expand on in terms of of giving comfort to investors that you will remain disciplined in terms of that capital deployment giving the the very strong out it should be part of the generation that you that you generate those will be my questions thank you so much well let me tell you we we are very optimistic of optional in in in the new york long run uh i think we have been probably platform and and uh it is just that we have uh the right consumer uh uh the adjustments in the lack of mobility that that that will help us to be in track again um um in terms of of your question about the e-commerce we're we're very much uh uh uh uh we are doing things that we are not prepared yet to disclose but i think we are in in the financial and the national fact that we see the evolution the and we have to be prepared and also the loyal controls related and connected with the financial platform um we we uh the current the current uh if you wanna see those are the ones as the think it is that we're making with the current platforms like amazon and everything we're very optimistic with those two what we don't know yet is the the home delivery home delivery still we don't see how the uh in fact the ones that are doing home delivery in small purchases not groceries but small purchases like the ones we deliver nobody makes money nobody makes money and and and they're still trying to to catch up and find a a better way so uh if we were in the grocery business without doubt that will be delivering a lot of things for the for the uh for homes because economically those make sense and the other the other ones we haven't seen yet although we have some tests to deliver in a very efficient way with some box stores and everything but i think there's still some learning and and efficiency to come uh come into place to to perform better i don't know we want to have uh uh uh uh to the question one thank you yeah thank you robert yes i do i think allen's first attempt of the question didn't work but the second attempt he made sure that we covered a fair amount of big topic so i will i will try to to to add to to some of these um so on the storefront uh island you know i think what what we're seeing is um you know we we've had for a number of years we've been opening more stores every year than the previous uh you know we got as high as thirteen fifty i think at the at the top um and i think what we're doing right now is we're taking this opportunity uh to look at the you know the you know there's a layer of stores that are probably marginal in terms of what they're contributing to the numbers and we're we're you know figuring out which of those stores actually should not be open uh kind of cleaning the base of a small uh number of stores that that should not be open and just generally i think uh you know the the budget for stores this year before you know the pandemic kind of weird it's it's ugly head we were thinking about twelve hundred stores for mexico so that you know that is a level it is a little bit lower than the top that we reached a couple years ago uh but you know we were already kind of moving into a phase where you are you're becoming more demanding about what you expect of your new stores in order to ensure uh profitability and productivity of the new stores and at the same time the budget for this year had us with about a hundred and fifty stores outside of mexico so i think um we are in the early stages of that process where uh international will begin to add add uh you know more meaningful numbers to the number of stores and obviously once you get some scale in colombia eventually hopefully brazil that it becomes uh not just a mexico story but more of a of a of a continental story uh so we are at that stage and i think this year with the pandemic with the dynamics uh we decided to to to start closing a few of those kind of marginal stores i'm also optimistic on the storefront that for central and western mexico now that we have uh the you know both portfolios of beers uh that there will be a large number of locations in places like <unk> even the value of mexico where uh the fact that you now have uh the api portfolio uh kind of takes a lot of those locations that we're just short of being viable makes them viable um and again kind of uh you know ensures that we can continue to open large numbers of stores in that part of the three um i think on the e-commerce front i mean a lot of the touch on it in terms of uh also obviously realizing the the potential and the power of the oxo platform um to bankerize people or to get people to adopt uh the new technologies or new products i mean i think we we we certainly have the <unk> experience that gives us a lot of comfort uh in terms of our ability to get people to sign up and and adopt a new new means of payment or new means of of of saving uh but one thing we don't want to do is do over promise and and under deliver so uh we are working hard at uh the three legged stool of uh our digital platform at <unk> which involves last mile delivery uh and i think more importantly the loyalty program and the e-wallet and hopefully we'll have something to show the market uh you know toward the end of the year and then finally on capital deployment um i mean you know you've seen us for over the year um films are basically has a couple of ways that that we grow uh we either take what we do well to a new geography or we take what we do well and we expand it by a couple of degrees and examples of this uh bound um whether you're talking about who was <unk> or some <unk> or or the drawster business where you took kind of oxford and and expanded what it does by a few degrees and and and you know said you're going to into drawsters so i think what we're doing right now and i think the market to your point in terms of how you find the question uh it's still kind of getting its hands around uh you know why it is that we made a couple of investments in the us um or how does the the janson business fit into the overall strategy um i think you're seeing us do kind of we usually do which is figuring out what you know what we do well and then taking it to another another country obviously with the benefit of very strong partners um as we have in in the us um so we understand that we you know we we are adding a little bit of complexity to the to the org chart um we will try to address that uh to the extent that we can by increasing the disclosure and when we're spoken about how we're going to start opening up the numbers for the logistics business as well as for the janson business uh first quarter of next year um so you know capital deployment uh these investments and and and addressing the complexity that it brings to the equation are very much a top of mind for for the team and and hopefully we are in the process of addressing it got it got it no thank you so much i mean you guys are extremely good not the best in the region in terms of large scale logistics of moving things and just to get it to possible for a lot of investors and animals supply i mean that logistic expertise has been moved to like all the way to small delivery like what they said into a largest point i mean i know i'm gonna say something very humbling and things that you already know but i'm not on tesla facebook um all of this company started without making money initially and uh they just they just gave the scale and uh this columbian guys wrapping it's a question market they're gonna be able to to control the small the small drop side delivery and i just think that and i think a lot of things that's the things that you have you have a great opportunity you have the balance you have the expertise and i think that yeah initially will nobody will make money and probably you get in you probably won't make money either but i want to get the scale eventually i think consumers will pay a premium for using uber for taking using paid group for using amazon and so forth and with a long term vision that turns for us i think that a lot of investors are king like why aren't you getting into that with more strength and using your you know muscle than your expertise but anyway thank you so much for taking my questions stay stay safe and have a great day thank you thank you all that i mean i just that question you know the the the concept or the notion of the super apps and how in in other geography so obviously uh things have evolved very quickly uh but we do have the aspiration with the you know with the right platform and the right partnerships uh to hopefully become become one of those uh or part of part of one of those ecosystems uh down the road and leverage quite frankly the the twenty thousand uh bricks and mortar stores that we have um which are the currentiating factor these are the other folks thank you so much thank you <unk> thanks you're rolling and now we'll go to rodrigo <unk> of scotia bank thank you uh guys um thanks for taking my question need to hear your thoughts on the state of them and pop stores in mexico on the one hand it's hard to imagine many will will not go on there of course uh and on the other hand higher unemployment they push many sort of shop and they form autonomy so any thoughts on what you seen on the ground that would be appreciated well i i i think the moment those were hardly hit unfortunately because of the lack of beer and that was uh uh and and i know would be lack of cigarettes because it was not on the deer and cigarettes i think we were able to to uh to uh uh prepare ourselves with good mentors and but again the um so those two were major uh they have a major effect on that uh in the other hand i think the um the traditional loan posts are closed where people leave so i think i would say there are different amounts to where where where where mobility is where a major role yes they didn't have hardly hit but these don't have i think the ones that are in the it's not neighborhoods i think they're they're coming up with with a real uh uh performance i would say also they they were better for the in the returnable bottles that the one the returnable soft drink compared with with also so that was a a a a more advantage but yes i again i i think they will recuperate because i think the uh uh the cock all assist and bingo and and i like are very much willing to support and and and and help and and and help them to be to compete and and and so i i do see that the pandemic in those labors i think is is so to to to to to sustain but yes but they were very hard to hit the ones that have a lack of beer in in in during this initial periods of the downturn great thank you and and just for it's the last question i guess um you you have uh taken some stakes in in certain startups um and i've seen that uh one of those uh who uh has been uh growing quite quite a bit um any insights or things that you have learned on the delivery in in in the states that that you can share yes you know we've we've been trying to support the uh with some venture money uh to support those suppliers uh that are very much aligned with us that will help us uh to enhance our our value proposition uh and i don't know specifically the one you're talking about one who might have a better idea of of but yes was working not only with the technological suppliers but also with with uh normal suppliers where we could help them uh to become larger and in fact we need that with uh um the a supplier that we have with <unk> could see the one that supported all the coffee operation and i think with that knowledge we could be of great uh uh support to them so this pandemic we also um uh we we all these small uh vendors we are helping them to pay them very quickly so they don't have these cash counts problems that this pandemic will cost to them and and uh so that that that those are the yes but our small scale suppliers are very important and it's strategic ones we want to invest with them so they can grow better and faster to become a major competitive advantage to us yeah i think on the on the <unk> investment i mean certainly we're we're trying to to help these these new ventures to to our ms ventures arm uh but also learn uh about uh you know things that that would help us in our own uh value proposition or the way that we operate and so it to me uh distribution the use of um you know dark dark warehouses or dark kitchens dark stores um the handling of perishables uh these are all things that that we would love to to be better at and to know more about and this this invest in particular obviously has has uh turned out to be an interesting one um i mean the the the the the amounts involved are are not huge in relative to the size of fence but certainly it's a startup that is doing very well and of course uh i know that you stay close to to to these companies and and and they're you know the different rounds of financing and and how could they're growing and and this is so far a very nice success story great uh thanks okay and we will go to alvaro garcia of p b p g actual good morning at one of the <unk> <unk> okay my question i have two questions sorry i have two questions one i'm fine again i was wondering if you could call in on whether or not your position on mistake on only you know this fifteen percent has changed or not it in the new tax agreement with the mexican government and two uh on mma fair to say or an integration role it seemed to be a nice time to sort of take agree there and and integrate a lot of the different uh uh assets you've you've bought over the last couple of years um doesn't have two questions thank you well the <unk> the <unk> uh yes is a temporary investment we just have to uh a way to uh uh deploy that capital in a better way and and and um it it is it is not as optimal as it was in the past but you're referring but it's we just have to find the the right time uh and and the right path to to uh deploy that capital and and and have that um um use of those proceeds um the second question uh i forgot one uh uh uh uh i forgot the second there's just i've got what's up on there are we ready to take a breather after a lot of activity of the m and a front uh and i think i mean i i think that the answer to that is is yes uh for the most part uh you should expect us to to start integrating uh capturing synergies and kind of uh delivering on the promise of all of all of these investments um i would i would say there there's probably one one uh exception uh and you know the the jam temp platform uh you know a big part of the of the attractiveness of that business involves um grow through acquisitions and eventual integration and you know it's hard to tell at this point whether there will be uh transactions kind of coming along uh in the coming months and orders but if they were um i think we would be interested in taking looks uh but other than that for the most part and understanding that m and a is hard to predict uh generally speaking the our stance is is one of these take kind of sitting a little bit more on our hands um and digesting the the number of bites that we took over the last eighteen months yes another thinking about the fourth platform that we are looking at i think we already have it so we don't we don't think to open a new vector uh a different vector for growth with the one that we have is already well established the proximity health um uh and and and and now these deals come back from i think we already very much okay we will be very much problems into the platform that we already have great that's very clear thank you very much okay now we will take our next question from a surgery <unk> a city uh yes hi good morning uh thank you for taking my question uh i have a i have two questions one is i wanted to go back on the uh the portfolio and uh the uh so the main question of at oxo uh you spoke about how you can you know change some of the assortments uh given the the economic slow then but um could you uh explain more on the assortment changes you can make uh in the face of the the the reduced mobility uh and especially over a long time if this changes the consumer habits uh like if if uh the mobility stay low for a long time that's the first question and the second question is in brazil logistics which are the biggest industries that those businesses served uh since you uh i i think in in we have better abilities and and competencies to suit the absorbing for economic downturn um lack of ability is it will be uh different because really also the time to serve uh people who are on on the go or on the street we have a hand in the past uh the daily and the management equity and and that is the uh groceries but not really buying the groceries and also is really the one that the the one that you are left out into pine tree and and this that really the patient that we have have been serving i think you've reached and then we've been able to uh to compare uh and the consumer that we have a a good assortment of of of for that uh country uh um uh well to find the problem you know that that they are left out in in in the country and and i think by testing for finding more they are finding that we have a good prices but i think that category um it will um if lack of mobility will be in place will have to expand that category compared with the uh uh uh uh lunch or or some other activities are more design to serve people that are on the go but i think that will take more uh more uh time and effort than to adapt to the economy downturn what yeah no i think i mean on that front uh it will be interesting for all of us to to see um whether you know the consumer begins to privilege proximity even more right in terms of these uh uh traditionally kind of supermarket type categories and whether our assortment and our pricing uh is compelling enough uh that which we will we will expect that it will be uh for some of these consumers to decide to not just a by the you know the cooking or the rice that they forgot or that they run out of uh during you know between trips to the supermarket but that they will use also as a more uh frequent uh source of this type of products and then we will make the next terry adjustments as as we go along uh i think on and i mentioned earlier the you know the the comment about spirits as another potential category where we uh hopefully uh will become more kind of top of mind for the consumer into terms of how how good an assortment and and how good our pricing is for that category um i think you also touched on on the second part of your question on uh the categories for brazil logistics um i think generally as we have been moving uh towards the ltl the les and truckload business uh and uh specialized work housing uh certainly pharma uh is an industry that is very well suited um for the for the type of of uh logistics that that that we do uh not just in the distribution part but also on the on the warehousing side in fact if you look at hv the company that we acquired a few months ago um the you know their biggest their biggest category it actually has to do with with health uh certainly a big component of of animal or veterinar health but also human health i think when you think about the the the equation or the relationship between the size of the products uh the way and the kind of the volume and the cost um and and the type of uh conditions that they require for the transportation and their storage uh it's an attractive industry it's a profitable industry and it's a very good fit with with what we do so i would say you should expect us to continue to try to grow in in that front obviously there are others there are cpg products and categories and companies electronics companies but uh certainly the health uh you know for both human and and with during our uh stand stand out assess uh probably one of the biggest technology biggest thank you and next question will come from carlos <unk> good morning everyone um john and uh constant hi john and constantina spoke of a concentrate price readjustment yesterday um it is the controlling shareholder and with really important rights in your equity agreement with coke what role is fence playing in this negotiation and what can you tell us about the longterm clarity of profit split with the brand owner well are they are they adequate for you at this point these agreements was trying like four years ago and yes we want to have we would love to have uh more stable and certain long-term relationship model and that that is something that is important for us and and and and important not only for the uh business portfolio holder it's very important for management because the way we we compensate management they have to have some certainty because uh uh that is very important for the long run and also for the uh uh minority shareholders uh the other c the company is is uh understand is and and i think it's really it's it's um we just have to be very creative um and and and and and and and technic from both sides in the sense that we are the same ship that is very important because probably in the in the past we were not as empathetic of to understand the income state of the recorded company and probably they were not as empathetic to understand our income statement and i think through these conversations that we had with them we are very much a line and then they have a problem understanding that we aren't expecting the same boat and the current economic sequences and the current consumer behavior we have to be very much a line so we're trying to build as we much align as possible alignment as possible and certainly so we can invest and develop and tackle the consumer the worst weekend and as i said we love and i think the main two projections have to be fully aligned food line and the uh uh build treatment team and trust the relationship for the long run so the tenure of the last agreement was a ten year agreement this one you just got a negoti four years ago that just you just finished making your last payments on it do you know what the tenure of this agreement is going forward or are we just really negotiating a long-term agreement now uh no we we we have this established and and and uh but it's it is uh uh something that that they have the time and and and and we we cannot disclose this to you uh without them being through their word but the worry were very happy with it and and and uh and in fact we would love to have these kind of agreements everywhere else we have given the certainty for the long run and alignment align then certainly and trust that's helpful thank you yeah i think that's fairly if i if i could um you know a few weeks ago in in one of the uh group calls that that you've helped us set up with with investors you you asked me the question of uh you know it's it possible to have a a long term relationship with with coke where where both partners uh realize uh uh uh a reasonable spread of roy versus whack and and i answered was was yes yes yes we can right i mean yes it is possible and i think the point i would make right now is that this is definitely uh not at odds with what uh you know what john constantina said yesterday i mean the alignment that is always talking about the expectation that there is a formula where both partners can make the right level of returns is what we are looking thank you okay now we'll take a question from ricardo elvis of morgan stanley morning gentlemen thanks for the call um most of my questions will be answered but uh if i may just assist a little bit more of the gems and asset appreciate your comments earlier now perhaps a bit more of a strategic question i mean how how do you you know how are you gonna be unlocking value on this acquisition in the long realm and one just mentioned the the manipulation um but you know as you merge the two companies you come up with the venture scenarios and so forth what's the plan in terms of how it fits to the overall um sense of platform or perhaps is just that the group for five of these assets just improved a lot of the pandemic and then you know m and a would really be the key driver for for future cash generation so just a few thoughts there would be helpful um and and then just a quick update on the have been with you uh as well yeah i i think we have uh a very good platforms for the meeting long run i think this pandemic has shot some some some uh uh damages but i think when the meeting long term we are that we have with health edition where and we have opportunities there for growth we have the opportunity division and then we have a a reveal statistic of the of the performance we're making in south america and the jd we made in in in in the field and also with our partnerships that we have here in in in in in in in the united states we're very think of domestic we have uh two great classrooms we have the uh uh the just a restaurant <unk> without <unk> i've been eating share part of the be of the pictures and this is a major competitive uh uh uh uh the strength that they have and we're very happy that and and the other hand in in in in the uh <unk> business we are um i think we made the right decision with the companies in west with the partners that we have and the platforms that have been established and the opportunities to for integration uh and i'm going forward for a more national uh uh uh footprint um as as i said we don't plan to open up a new factor for growth i think the ones are there and we just have to very keen and and probably there is short term uh uh pandemic disturbance uh like cope with it align better uh make efficiencies and probably make some decisions to adjust ourselves to this new environment but you have great platforms for growth uh uh in the future one yeah i know i i think i would uh just following up on what you just said at level um you know on the whole jenson uh platform uh there are certain only you know there's just an industry that is very highly fragmented um where you don't really have a huge incumbent um the platform that we are forming by combining uh waxing north american already becomes uh one of the larger years um with uh you know the the the waxies it's it has a kind of a bias to the west coast of the us uh north american out of chicago has more of a midwest uh all the way down to florida coverage but you really don't have uh players with anything resembling uh big national presence and so the synergy component um the the aspiration to integrate more of these assets um at the right time and in the right way is a big part of i think the the aspiration that that we have for that business scale is a beautiful thing we we we have uh been the beneficiaries of scale in many of our businesses um and this is another one where we think that could work uh it's it's magic you've done it in the right way um i think you also uh mentioned at the end of your question something about an update on the on the jv in brazil um you know obviously the the pandemic uh throws a little bit of sound into the gears uh in terms of the the pace of openings uh down there but quite frankly um we are almost uh on track uh in terms of uh openings for both the first uh new stores on the select side on the on the gas stations of license uh but also on the on the standalone oxo side so we we do aspire to start opening stores uh oxo stores uh towards the end of the year uh in in brazil we are already uh making progress in the terms of uh setting up our first distribution center down there as well uh so things are going uh very much according to plan and like i said i think the pandemic has not uh forced the team down in brazil to depart very much from the you know uh plan obviously this is uh we've said before this is not gonna be a piece of cake you know figuring out the right value proposition for for the brazilian oxo it's going to take a little bit of time uh but the size of the opportunity and and certainly the the partnership that we have uh make us very very optimistic that uh this will eventually be an important part of the portfolio and i think the partnership that we have with <unk> and and and and i think it's uh it's we found uh that's been proximity division really uh center commercial found the right way to go into this room they're very happy they're learning a lot in fact they are learning us through uh um and and they're going to be adopted some of the select operations to these new skin and i think there's um uh a lot of uh we see a lot of goals uh and and potential to adjust the value proposition of the select stores and the actual stores in the field and i think that will be very um uh uh but it will take time it will take time but i think we're very optimistic got it thank you so much now we'll go back to a follow up from gustavo olivia of ubs uh thank you for taking my follow up question for me um yesterday all max uh conference called the nation uh uh some risks uh we went back to the introduction of the new labeling uh regulation rules that we'll start already in october uh would you please help us understand what could be the impact of those uh new labeling rules uh in your in your oxford business perhaps during the transition time now uh as as it's implemented in october and perhaps in in your ability of of our on your supplier's ability to push for for sales gold we we think that the uh sometimes too much information for the consumer and and and and and it seems like what i've been learning i think is very important to inform the consumers so the consumer can do the better decision for the uh their their uh i don't know the health and and and nutrition and everything sometimes if the if the if the uh labeling goes a bit too far the concern might be blocking some of some of so so much information that he doesn't want to have uh uh uh he just uh overloaded by this uh uh uh vaping we don't know really where we will stand and and i think the the the could be we ever okay very closely with the with the with us our suppliers and i think we'll be very in a very good position to adapt to this new uh environment we don't see major these races uh happening um i don't you want to ask to to this one i mean just just the point that i think on on beverages certainly on the coke from society generally um the consumer has been well informed for many years now about out you know the calorie count and that sort of thing and and the industry has been evolving for a while increasing the percentage of the of the portfolio that has reduced uh or no calories at all um and so i think the you know the challenges from the from the labeling involve more you know the costs and the kind of the the operating uh conundrums of you know changing labels or adjusting your packaging that sort of thing but not so much in terms of the incremental information that the consumer would receive there there are other categories where uh maybe the the consumer has not been as exposed to nutritional information um and i think for those there will be a period of adaptation uh but to a lot of those point uh you know i think also is it is it's very well positioned and the the the flexibility and the the the level of uh dialogue and cooperation with suppliers uh leads i think to to what should be a relatively smooth transition when this eventually becomes uh a fact so during this transition uh one and the other uh do you foresee uh um the risk of uh a more aggressive markdown just to get rid of the inventory that is with the old labeling and before or or suppliers they're gonna uh assume the costs um you know of of that operation i think that could impact your your four two results or perhaps part of your three two results no but i i we if we we uh i never i never the turnover of any thirty in in in in also goes very fast and the variable will be some opportunities very what would it will will make some money uh yes i i think it will be uh probably uh uh and i'm trying to i don't know when no i agree with you that uh our inventory levels and uh you know tend to be small and and the turnover is fast and i'm sure we will work with suppliers and come up come up with promotional activity as required um and i don't think it's something that is that is causing us to lose a lot of fleet at this point thank you very much for the clarification thank you thank you and <unk> gentlemen that is all the time we have for questions today i will now turn the conference back to mr pedia for posing additional remarks uh well thank you everyone uh thank you very much for you in today's state's state and we will thanks everyone and gentlemen <unk> gentlemen if you wish to replay the webcast this call you may do so at <unk> to relations website this concludes our conference for today thank you for your participation and have a nice day all parties may now disconnect
