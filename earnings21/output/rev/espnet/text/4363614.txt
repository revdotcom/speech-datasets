pandemic on the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers has remained our utmost priority before giving you an update on the measures that were implemented in this regard let me begin a review by providing context this past quarter has been a quite challenging as we started seeing the impact of the pandemic on the mexican economy on our business and of course on our results despite the impact let me assure you that our bank remains strong and focused first our capital liquidity levels and solid and well above the minimum regulatory levels second we have a clear study which we are executing to support our customers and minimize the impact on the pandemic on the finances and third we expect to emerge from this difficult environment as a stronger institution business volumes closed the second quarter with high single digit year on year growth while we experience an adverse shift in our portfolio mixed towards lowering building segments consumer and sme loans started to contract in line with market trends while the commercial and mortgage loans were sealed and continued to register as functions the tiny measures implemented by bank of the mexico and the cnbv how allow us to maintain ample levels of liquidity and capital enabling us to offer our customers support mechanisms to temporarily elevate their cash flow and the financial stress cost by economic fallout to the pandemic although at the quality deteriorated slightly in the quarter we make creative loan loss provisions of three point nine billion vessels in addition to the normal quality provisions in preparation for our future losses we would revised this amount in the in the future as more information becomes available on the performance of our long portfolio to in the coming quarters as we normally do we will provide a number of view of our business environment but then mean facades again our conviction that's into the mexico is very well positioned against the current and is still growing economy part of that covid nineteen pandemic in flight four would percent select economic indicators that show the magnitude of the fact in the pandemic is having economic activity in having economic activity and employment as you might recall twenty twenty gdp growth expectations for the mexican economy were modest prior to the pandemic mainly with private investment hospitals with april and made indicators showing a contraction of more than twenty percent during during economic activity and thirty seven percent on year and year and drop in fixed investment market conceptual expectation have been revised down to a right nine percent annual decrease in gdps or in two twenty two thousand twenty for additional context this would be an economic contraction not seen in many decades this significant fall in economic activity resulted in the loss of more than one million formal jobs during the second quarter according to social security that time both as many as twenty million jobs lost taking into accounting formal and following the past two severe economic crisis back in ninety five and two thousand nine it took seven quarters for the mexican economy to recover its previous level of economic activity however in the current one we consider this unlikely that the economy could recover within a similar period of time given the death and ninety two of the global economic shock and the absence of any meaningful physical program to address the severe contraction in any employment with external demand rounding only gradually and without any mechanism to alleviate households income loss and not an economy like mexico faces a slow path to recover previous activity levels with two thousand twenty one growth but we forecasted only plus three percent it could take three to four years to recover two thousand and nineteen levels of activity under these conditions inflation pressures should remain low we expect three points for two thousand and twenty allowing bank of the mexico to cut interest rates a little further we expect another hundred basis points of course through the year for the year which would take the reference rate around four percent a year in summary this scenario of low growth and low interest rates represents a challenging outlook for mexico commercial and consumer environments and for our business you turn to slide five you will notice that despite a severe shock to economic activity and employment the systems loans and the positive volumes still show a significant year over years pension of eight percent and fourteen percent respectively this is made is claimed by large and medium-sized companies and government entities that have drawn on the credit lines to maintain the liquidity of the relationships in order to continue operating during the month of which the stay at home guidelines have been in effect on the other hand consumer loans showed a relevant contraction reflecting the initial impact of the pandemic and consumer behavior and of problem to realization practices being maintained by financial institutions it is worth knowing that system-wide demand deposits remains strong update up eighteen eight or eighteen percent year and year like you're reflecting heightened it needs for liquidity among households and companies but still at home guidance remain in effect please turn to slide six or we would like to give you an update on the bank operations during the past few months will help and business continue to continue the protocols remaining the such as a spending non-essential probably limiting the number of people that gatherings and group events and enhance seventy eight sanitization measures of branches corporate offices atms and contact centers as of today most corporate employees continue working from home while only a station personnel are working onsite approximately eighty percent of the bank branches are open ninety two percent of our atm locations are functioning normally the bank digital channels and contact centers have also been operating normally our digital monetary transactions increase sixty four percent year and year while our digital sales represented for four percent of total sales plus as much as they did last year as we continue promoting customers use of the ten channels which continues to drive adoption levels further more ip resources having challenged into implementing this and we are multioperating tools with cyber security being a priority during this critical time we have been supporting our customers throughout that's a relief program offering different payments for individuals and sms and case by case that researchers to our corporate customers i will elaborate in this program in the moment as part of our commitment to our communities we have made numbers donations and supporting initiatives that aid the medical community and vulnerable populations also needed an app to the mexico city government which allows the population to self diagnose based on symptoms locate medical facilities within capacity near them and obtain information on the pandemic on slide seven you will find a snapshot of our debt support program that i mentioned before currently nineteen percent of our total loan portfolio is under the payment holiday program for individual and sms with more six hundred thousand customers benefiting from it through this program we are helping customers who have encountered liquidity programs by permitting them to escape loan payment both interest and principle for four months without any penalty or cost because of this feature under the program it is difficult to assess at this time the extent of the pandemic's impact on arrested quality however we have been proactive in addressing as well it over the past few months by contacting our customers to better understand the financial situation and by analyzing their ability to pay more than fifty five percent of our branch network personally let's focus on recovery calling customers directly livewise the collections and commercial and with departments segmented the portfolio by level of concern identifying risk and exposure according to customer quality through this more granular process we are this smart creating each type of client within thirty six different clusters we have also been analyzing our customer behavioral patterns using our crm capabilities i know that more of ninety five percent of our payroll customers continue to receive the salaries for those payroll customers who are not longer receiving the salary we are collecting for unemployment insurance with current information we estimate that close to forty percent into our customers should be able to continue honoring fully the condition of their loans they need i think uh since it is uh still clear if the rest will be able to remain current we are offering offering loan restructures for many of them in order to speed up the recovery process it will not be until the third and four quarters of this year that we will have sufficient hard data on the behavior of the portfolio with regard to our commercial book we are taking a case by case approach to manage our exposure as we did during the past critical periods we can remain very close to our customers and are helping them navigate this current challenging environment for those companies that face difficulties we can been offering multiple alternatives to support them our current portfolio of commercial research loans is close to fifty billion pencils and accounts for sixteen percent of our loan portfolio with medium and large size corporates in addition to actively managing our portfolio know that seventy six percent of our payment holiday portfolio is associated with the mortgages and sms which both have guarantees within our top lifting book sixty seven percent of the portfolio is backed up by warranties issued by <unk> one of mexico development banks which allows us to share the risk with them specifically for also the needs that are in the developed program seventy five percent ends of them have warranties furthermore payrolls and auto loans nine percent of the third portfolio are semi secured given the collateral word presented by each customer salary and car please start to slide eight but i would like to share with you some of the key characteristics of our multiple multi portfolio which is giving us relative comfort due to the defensive nature our organic mortgage portfolio accounts for eighty six percent of all our mortgages the fifty port portfolio have a loan to value ratio of forty four percent while the resignation has an ltb of seventy percent providing very good wear anti-coverage the npl ratio of this portfolio is three point six percent and has been quite stable for some time for the past two years i will pick up loose mortgage has allow us to attract higher income customers which are more offensive in the growing environment to expand to this point our average ticket has been increasing since our lunch since we launched the problem and it's currently not only the highest amount of views but thirty thirty seven percent higher than the average ticket of our peers in addition if we pick up plus customers are loyal as they also have their payroll and their credit cards with us having a low loan to valuations as well as being the main bank of our customer lowers the pro ability of non-payment at this type of customer tends to prioritize the home mortgages in economic downturns only not considering the level of warranties we have the structure for our portfolio and the proactive assures we are taking we consider we are on the right path to mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic on the quality of the loan portfolio on the slide line that we comment on the regulation dynamics and the mix we have seen the in the past few months commercial loans continue to support for the long road therefore their contribution within local loan regulation increased from seventy eight percent in the second quarter of nineteen to eighty two percent in the second required in two thousand twenty in nineties commercial loans now represent sixty four percent of our total loans these changing mix has had an impact on our n ai as we will explain larry in the code in terms of regulation dynamics we have seen encouraging trends during the quarter that i worked noting here in the mortgage and commercial segments june's loan regulation registered relevant sequential improvements compared to may surpassing january two thousand and twenty level in consumer loans june loan origination remains twenty five percent below the first quarter in twenty monthly average however it is standard thirty three percent and above the two thousand twenty minimum which that's april as you continue like that are capital equity positions are very strong at the end of june are common with you here one ct one ratio is still at eleven point six percent fifty eight basis points above march and was significantly in excess of the eight point two percent minimal requirement established for the banks our size the decision taken during april shareholders meeting to postpone the dividend payment for two thousand nineteen has allow us to further strength our capital position in terms of liquidity our second quarter in two thousand and twenty liquidity conversation which two hundred and eleven percent well above the banks the bank called a mexico regulatory requirement and supported by the senior notes we should back in april before turning the call over to the year i would like to finish my remarks by reiterating that we have been active city and decided to further strengthen our bank in order to mitigate the impact of the current crisis on our operations in addition to implementing proper protocols and measures to protect our employees and call customers we have continued serving clients with high standards of customer service through our branches and the it and channels again we are confident that our bank is well positioned to support the customers as they recover from these unprecedented crisis now let me pass the call over to the year who will review the part of most important trends and metrics thank you thank you actor good day everybody please turn to slide eleven for an overview of a recent loan performance total loans expanded seven percent year a year with contracting contracted three percent sequentially given a strong corporate loan demand at the end of the first day quarter loan margin segments are growing twice as fast as high margin segments where smes and curry cars contracted nine percent and six percent year in year respectively due to the economics to the economies weak performance by contrast mortgage loans increased a solid nine percent year in year and expanded thirteen percent when excluding the run of effect of a g e n i n g portfolio which was well about market growth high margin segments have reduced her contribution to net interest income by almost a hundred basis points individual loans on the slide twelve she all slow down growing four percent on a year on year basis mainly supported by mortgages as mentioned previously mortgages have proved to be defensive segment within the mexican market during the past periods of economic and stability with this in mind we decided to low were even more the rate for a protective plus product to seven point seven five percent targeting loyal customers as of june close to sixty percent of our mortgage origination was coming from a protective plus which allows to increase cross selling of other products in july we launched a new product a new mortgage product called <unk> which is the first commission free mortgage product in mexico unique characteristics of this product are the customers do not have to pay an application fee monthly commission we're a home of place so nor are life and unemployment insurance required living only not only fees to be paid by the customer when occurring this product as you can see even during these challenging times we haven't stopped you know there continues to be a time we're trending credit card loans as we take a more conservative approach toward this segment in addition to matching customers credit limits credit card usage decline thirty percent year over year during the quarter as many clients stayed at home this job had a negative impact on balances of course as to usage rates reach a very low level in april they recover in may and june of the remaining slight below first quarter levels growth in our consumer loans has been concentrated in payroll loans growing two point five percent year and year and still above the market per cmbv data as of the end of may personal loans continue it to contract consistent with our strategy to focus on more defensive segments of the market as sector noted finally our auto loan production in june more than double compared to previous quarters average boosted by our new commercial and items with mazda turning to slide thirteen growth in our base of loyal digital customers continuous demonstrated important progress with your year increases of almost seventeen percent and thirty one percent perspectively despite the challenging business environment loyalty penetration that is loyal to active customers stands at thirty five percent four hundred percent higher than a year ago we have seen continuous growth in the use for digital channels so customers have stayed home to independent this quarter product sales data the channels accounted for forty four percent of the total almost building year ago levels data monetary transactions also spect which is almost one third of the total for model transactions will be center ninety three percent of total detail transactions versus eighty four percent in twenty nineteen mobile customers also kept growing at a solid thirty eight percent year in year rate reaching four point three million at the end of the quarter you can see on the slide for team commercial loans grew nine percent year in year but decrease essentially as some corporates started preparing some lines withdrawn in the first quarter of this year government and middle market segments continue to register double visit year in your expansion although the sequential evolution showed lower and stable volumes respectively the same loans register a fourth sequential quarterly contraction as this segment showed a weekend train even for the pandemic outstanding loans are similar to the ones we had in the fourth quarter of twenty seventeen ten quarters ago the number twenty is also related to our lower risk appetite for lending in the sme segment given that more than fifty percent of our sme loan will join the payment holiday the for our program and those customers cannot use their credit lines while in the program loan origination in this segment will remain low until we have more visibility on the performance of the economy moving on to talk called the positives on the slide fifteen this increased ten percent year and year while quarter and quarter with three percent contraction during the quarter there was a shift between the month and time the positive favor by lower interest rates as of the the second quar of this year demand deposits represented sixty four percent of total deposits and were up eleven percent year in year the post growth from individual stands stands out at twenty three percent year in year supported by a promotion campaign to a track these types of deposits after a typical first quarter of this year deposits from individuals continue to grow faster than corporate deposits in line with our strategy to further increase our exposure to retail deposits we tell the past it now represents thirty thirty three percent of total deposits almost four hundred basis points higher than its contribution in the first quarter of twenty eighteen during july sixteen we have a very strong capital and liquidity position as sector have highlighted we maintain a sound funding position with a net loans to the process ratio of ninety one point eight percent one of the stronger levels since becoming a listed company our liquidity coverage increased eighty nine percentage points relative to the first quarter of this year and now stands at two hundred and eleven percent well about the regulatory threshold of a hundred percent we also remain very comfortable with our debt profile with manageable debt maturities regarding capitalization ratio increased forty six basis points sequentially to sixteen point seven percent reflecting the postponent of the different payments that recommended by the banking commission while our court here one ratio was up fifty eight basis points to let and point six percent and our tier one ratio stood at thirteen point zero three percent as you can see on the late seventeen eighteen test income decreased four percent year in year and six percent quarter and quarter as a result native was marching contracted a hundred twenty eight basis points to four point five percent for the quarter our marching decline was a result of lower interest rates and lower balances within the high building segments couple with higher average assets as a consequence of significant increase in our security portfolio without this last effect uh our name would have contracted only fifty four basis points a sector explained earlier we're expecting that interesting come to continue contracting so during the remainder remainder of the year due to anticipated decreases in interest rates combined with a change in our portfolio mix where growth would likely come from low children segments and with a likely contraction ideal in segments however this under pressure will be partially medicated or expanded investment in securities portfolio please move on to slide eighteen net commissions and fees decreased two point one percent year in year affected the the double digit decline in credit card transactions credit card usage decrease forty two percent in april thirty four percent in may and fourteen percent in june on a year on year basis insurances register only slide contraction given renewals of several groups insurance policies which partially compensated for software insurance demand insurance represents almost thirty percent of our total fees and has proven to be a defensive segment even considering the pandemic we felt a life insurance growing while written insurance is slightly decreased our investment banking team has been very active mainly in financial advisory services which translated into on fee growth of thirty one percent in this line of our business which partially compensated for weaker results in other areas mainly credit card fees turning to slide nineteen gross per income grew nine percent year in year driven by a solid performance in market related income which was significantly above our historical average levels of between six hundred to eight hundred million passes required the current interest rates the fx market volatility especially during a april and may supported market making income in addition withhold investment in securities in order for the strength thing our liquidity position generating our recurring gains that posted these quarters resolved all this contributed for market layer income that accounted for thirteen point eight percent of gross operating revenues three point five times higher than historical average of four percent moving on to permissions on the by twenty in light of the deterioration of mexico's economic environment and in anticipation of a possible deterioration of a low portfolio both due to the pandemic in june we register a special charge of low lungs provisions on top of the normally require the three point nine billion pesos charge raised total permissions to eight point thirty five billion pesos in the quarter up eighty eight percent year and year and sixty two percent sequentially we have made this as mate of printed provisions with the information currently at hand however this amount could be revised in the future as more information becomes available cost of risk for the quarter still at three point nine percent a forty four basis point year in your increase and forty nine basis points sequentially our total mpl ratio showed a slide twenty eight basis points year over year increase to two point five percent mainly due to the sme segment together we are mortgage and credit card portfolio as explained earlier this ratio only reflect the performance of eighty one percent of our total portfolio that does not fall under the payment holiday program we consider this ratio encouraging as its evolution is quite benign when considering the significant deterioration in economic activity and employment however it would not be until the third and fourth quarter of this year of this year that the doctor's program will land it will be at that time when mpl ratios will reflect the real magnitude of the economic impact of the pandemic now please turn to a slide twenty one administrative and promotional expenses increase one point two percent year in year reflecting the if the f work to control personal costs mainly research for viable compensation and a more decision expensive related to the strategic and it investments that we made over the past three years as we will continue investing in the digitalization of the bank and technology upgrades we're targeting greater operating efficiencies in the common quarters such as the ability to reduce the number of business trips variable compensation as well as limiting based salary increases among other improvements less business travel and salary caps already led to a sequential one point nine percent decrease in our total expenses during the second quarter of this year such expense controls combined with strong operating income and the conclusion of our three year investment plan contributed to a three hundred and fifty eight pay this point improvement in our efficiency ratio which decreased to forty point seven percent on a six months basis the ratio improve two hundred twenty seven basis points year on year to forty two point three percent thirty into profitability on slide twenty two you will note that our earns were mainly impacted by special loans provisions that we discussed earlier profit before taxes was down twenty four percent year and year for the quarter and eleven percent for the first half of the year net income decreased twenty five percent year and year to four point two billion vessels while our effective tax rate increased thirty eight basis points year and year to twenty five point three percent this resulted in an eleven point five percent and decrease in net income for the first six months six months of twenty twenty which was nine point six billion passes return on equity was eleven point nine percent five hundred forty three basis points below the year ago level and down three hundred and sixty two basis points sequentially year today <unk> contracted three hundred twenty eight basis points to thirteen point five percent let me now turn the call back to <unk> for some final remarks then so please go ahead <unk> please turn to slide twenty three let me share with you some final thoughts on what lies ahead given the unprecedented nature of this health crisis and those certainty surrounding iteration of magnitude we anticipate only a very gradual recovery of the economy which was obvious implications with regard to our operating environment we affect our long portfolio we likely be driven by customer loans mainly medium and large corporates corporate loans as well as mortgages the consumer will call very gradually and this will depend on the speed of the rental turnaround in employment economic activity as well as reasons are going your confidence although visibility and asset quality is limited due to the parent holiday program we have been talking um and taking rapid and decisive action in order to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the loan book a recovery plan which includes a very detailed and in the analysis of each customer situation is allowing us to preemptively and simply uh prepare the bank for complicated partners ahead in part we have allocated a large number of current employees and branches involved in carrying out recovery strategy we will continue focusing on enhancing customer loyalty and uncross selling non-credit products to support non-in their single we also remain committed to make an additional investment in the bank transformation mainly in it and the utilization but we will continue to look for efficiencies in other lines with a strict cost control in order to support a bottom line and finally rest assured that our banks is operating from a position of strength rewards capital and high liquidity levels that will allow us to overcome this complicated but what we believe are temporary circumstances we are not ready to take good questions let's go ahead thank you if you would like to ask the question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you're using a speaker phone please make sure you're mute for question is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question please ask one question and a follow-up if you have further questions please re-enter the queue we'll pause for just a moment till everyone and upper <unk> to signal for questions thank you our first question is from the line of <unk> please go ahead thank you very much uh my question is on the operating outlook um the disclosure's excellent is always been i like the way you presented it um on slide nineteen we we can look at the the main um the main drivers for the operating income and clearly as you we talked about market related revenue was very strong well above uh historical levels about fourteen percent of the total operating income compared to let's say three or four percent in the past uh these are different times but how should we think about efficiency going forward you talked about cost control we saw that um if you can just give us some a general sense you mentioned uh you there are certain costs you're you can control and you are controlling can you talk a little bit about the physical infrastructure is there an opportunity to rationalize physical branch net work um after the investments you made um what should we be looking for in terms of efficiency going forward the dynamic is is quite skewed from all of these moving parts the very high trading um and and the low the low revenues given what's going on thank you thank you look i mean as you have said i mean if you take a look at our numbers basically we have uh decreased uh the operation cost of the bank quite significantly i mean first of all i mean not traveling and not doing many things we have reduced naturally the cost but we have also been very strict in the new projects and new situation i mean we are basically focusing all our expenses in it to support the backbone and to be ready for what's coming uh so in that sense that's gonna be our priority secondly we are taking a look uh uh and we're doing a big dive in terms of uh all our infrastructure and um we're not gonna get take i mean rock decisions in terms of closing down a big number of uh of um branches or anything like that i think we're gonna be rationally looking at each of the micro markets that we have divided the country into and when we decide um with the evolution of the economy what should happen there so uh but we're gonna be very strict if you have seen the grow over the past uh four or five years in terms of branches we actually have decreased the normal of total branches we have just um we have been very intelligent in the way we have managed that what we have done is upgraded uh the current and the most important which we are one of basically the uh taking a little bit more time than the time that we were thinking of of um upgrading all the branches are not up to the standard so this actually what doing we're gonna basically rationalize all the all the expending and do it on where the most important thing is that is basically the it platform and the the utilization of the bank so in that sense we're gonna be very concentrated on that uh we also believe that i mean given that we have been able to operate at the bank on the dc context we have a huge amount of people basically working from home uh you basically get to understand exactly how really how much people do you need what can you rationalize et cetera so what you're gonna see promote is that we're gonna be very responsible in the way we manage that and concentrate on those points we're working currently in that plan we're working on our three year plan and we're basically including all these uh in our solution maybe uh there's a follow up just some comments on what you've seen uh throughout your peers into something their group in the region or elsewhere are there other things you think that could be applied to mexico that could help um perhaps on the side of the banking system perhaps in terms i operationally or it or or any factors at all thank you what we're doing basically is for example i mean in terms of developing the data platforms et cetera but we're doing it we're doing it now instead of each country basically developing the platforms we are doing it uh together so that basically is gonna help out quite a lot so uh it's not mexican for example right now in mexico we're developing the newspaper app and the newspaper app is going to be used in in in in all the other con regional for example the onboarding uh for smes we're using the one that is being developed in europe so all those types of things are gonna help us out basically in reducing our costs uh for the infrastructure that we do developing and we're working together much more within the group in order to do that so you're gonna see that i mean the cost of uh basically developing things and it's gonna come down to the fact that we're doing it together with the rest of our <unk> okay so those times are great that's the main thing at this point thank you appreciate it well thank you the next question comes from the line of <unk> from morgan stanley please go ahead hi good morning everyone um i wanted to ask about net interest margin um you you pointed out that you expect further um complications in the next couple of quarters given uh falling rates and weak uh loan demands and uh make deterioration um as you look at twenty twenty one uh in the context of what you said on not a strong economic recovery next year and with average rate next year being much lower than twenty twenty if you did rate end up at four percent okay um what is the expectation for net interest margin next year and for ai is it possible that we're likely to see another year of um ai compression and and to what extent that have the offset uh elsewhere in the pnl and and my second question is on um uh on the coverage ratio and and i and i know that that the thanks knowing my linkedin's entirely in a conversation i get it um but but that again i believe that the the size of your reserves uh have a relationship to the size of your lump of the size of your mails and the size of the amount of loans that are on their restaurant train um and so when i look at your corporate ratio one hundred one hundred and thirty eight percent it looks low relative to <unk> that are up at two hundred and one percent and back over here at one hundred eighty five percent so i i wonder you know why why not just you know take a much bigger charge on provision of this worker um you know eventually there's there's there's a lot of uncertainty ahead and um the more the better and and so is this piece meal just going to you know potentially put more pressure on your earnings going forward rather than just you know take a really big one soup and you know raise your coverage the north of two hundred percent um and and that like you made something from doing the third order thank you um look okay i will ask um this second i will ask um i will answer the first part and then i will ask you to complete on the on the basic numbers of um i mean first of all i mean if you saw the presentation we are basically changing the mix of um of the credit loan portfolio okay first of all i mean uh if you have seen i mean uh we have degrees quite a lot out also unfortunately to sms even the lack of uh work is from the government from <unk> okay so uh the portfolio has they're almost ten percent so in that sense uh that basically is a high in portfolio which um it's going to continue to shrink and let's we we see some guarantees from the government and you if you see our portfolio which is quite important we have like sixty two percent of it already <unk> okay the court's portion this basically goes to answer your second part of the question in terms of uh the amount of uh the amount of research that we have done um then you see that uh also we see that for example consumer credit and consumer loans are gonna decrease as well so the mix is complete really changing and we're going i mean we're going basically back to where we were five years ago when we had much more exposure to corporate and to medium sized companies than to consumer laws remember that we that different things okay so that's why nya is shrinking on the other side what we also been doing is we are pricing and we are very strict on pricing risk okay so um we've been increasing the marching on the corporate loans quite significantly due to that fact you know that we are basically looking at the risk that we are taking and uh we are looking very closely at the waitings of those companies and we are pricing risk accordingly okay this is not a situation which we want to spend the portfolio for the great portfolios of to expand it we are basically doing it just to the companies that we believe that have a future and that will be there in the next few years and both will price in the risk accordingly so in that sense you're gonna feel going towards that also the other concentration is mortgages which we uh which we believe i mean there is a sector still uh of growth i mean as you know there is a lack of uh or a big deficit in terms of homes in mexico so we believe there is still a part of the population that can afford to mortgage uh mortgages penetration mexico is quite low versus a red and also low penetration is quite low so we believe there is a chance to to to continue to penetrate that sector and maybe on payrolls on some situations we will basically be uh also lending in that in that part i mean and also loans also we have seen some interesting uh development there with the a cultural approach or to it so in that sense the list of the proposal is going to change and probably they can let you know it's actually held with the n a i a boarding in terms of what you were asking in terms of um the reserves uh we we we actually been doing research accordingly to what we believe we are doing uh in terms of uh uh how the portfolio is um is uh behaving at this point what i can tell you is that the portfolio not payments holidays is behaving much much better than we believed that it was gonna that it was gonna turn actually i'm quite surprised about it hopefully it continues that way but in that sense where basically being in my opinion uh being very responsible in the amount of uh of reserves that we are making at this point also we have done a tremendous job uh with that uh that we have in reviewing the portfolio on holidays and that portfolio is being divided as we said in twenty six clusters okay these clusters have been divided upon we help on the amount of risk we have a niche particular situation and in some of these portfolios even before the payment holiday ends we are already talking to clients and discussing the way that we could get to even those particular situations because what we believe is that whoever gets paid first is the one again that is the one that is gonna get paid so we are basically being very aggressive in that sense to talk to our clients and basically trying to get that to recover the portfolios you have seen fifty five percent of our branches have been turned into uh collecting branches i mean to basically this we're dedicating our executives to collect we have divided them open them in the sectors that we believe are the ones that are the ones that are gonna be much more important or that are gonna be hit the most in the economy so in that sense i really were very well prepared although i mean nevertheless uh it's always i mean a lot of uncertainty what's happening and we didn't want to go overboard we believe it's the right um the right approach is the one that we have made but we will continue to over the next few months evolution but i can tell you that we're going to be very conservative in the what we manage that okay um yeah i don't know if you want to complete absolutely absolutely i would like to compliment on what you may sure uh great talking to you for a long time to speak um in terms of uh uh names you know uh definitely you know as we laid out in the presentation we see significant pressures and let me just give you um background information that i think it's it's uh it's quite relevant um the the speed at which interest rates have come down in mexico is is is is significant you know just in this quarter uh the other each of the reference reference rate came down a hundred and twenty three basis points that's the the the fastest decline that we've seen uh in the recent history we we didn't saw uh an increase of those uh you know that magnitude when when interest rates were were coming up okay so that's one thing to have in mind that the the the impact in them that you've seen this quarter i think is probably the most severe that we're gonna see in a relative basis relative to the first quarter of this year and relative to the second quarter of last year okay uh also very in mind that when interest rates were close to four percent and as we probably agree with you that that's where we're headed you know our name was close to five percent you know and this was you know the second and third water of twenty sixteen uh i think that uh you know the the the number that we reported before forty eight percent in this quarter and it has to do with with what i was referring to you know speed that which interest rates came down okay and also on top of that you have the the you know the change in in mix on our the loan size and also the fact that in order to protect the uh letting income from uh uh interest rates coming down we we increased our uh investment securities portfolio uh significantly you know and those are you know lower margin uh uh as it's relative to uh the the the long portfolio just just to uh you know share with you uh we've bought you know and this taking account you know both uh divestments and and maturities the overall growth in our investment insecurity portfolio is ninety six billion pesos over the last twelve months so what we expect coming that on the road you know pay for the rest of twenty twenty and the you know next year i think that uh you know having said that there's still a lot of uncertainty you know i think that the the the most severe numbers in terms of name are the ones that we saw this quarter you know there's probably you know ten to fifteen basis points uh probably further adjustment or uh improvement for the rest of the year okay and next year i think that uh we'll we'll probably get to see names similar or slightly above to the ones that we were seeing uh in this quarter okay now regarding the coverage ratio you're totally right in the sense that we don't target that coverage ratio that's that's a resulting number and also you know when you the make reference to you know our number a hundred thirty eight percent looks low relative to <unk> you have a north in the first quarter of this year they had a hundred forty percent in this in the second quarter they did a as we did also you know uh increase the provisions for different to us you know they did a significant charge of four point six billion passes so that's why you know uh their conversation increased to two hundred uh percent uh they i'm probably just elaborate in elaborately elaborating the the more on what tector mentioned you know uh the level of provisions that we have are in line with the effective losses at the we we estimate um you know you might have a you know a or you might question you know whether we you know this is enough or not you know and let me share with you that uh you know on the consequences we have definitely done different types of sensitivity analysis or scenario analysis okay so if there is a big type recovery in the mexican economy you know we have with these quarters uh permissions we're you know more than covered you know for the rest of the year now do we think that there's gonna be a v type recovering the mexican economy i don't think so you know it's very you know low product now we we have assessed uh you know the the level of provisions according to other type of uh scenarios you know uh more a u type or an adverse uh scenario having a gdp contraction of twelve and a a percent you know and under those circumstances these quarters provisions are not enough for the entire year there could be close to seven sixty to seventy five percent depending on the magnitude of the gdp a contraction that that you assume okay so so there there should be a direct correlation between effective losses and provisions and the provisions that we are putting forward we think that with information that we have uh are you know quite strong to cover you know expected losses if the economy ends up con acting more than we are expecting right now definitely we will need to provide additional provisions something that i encourage you to look at if you haven't done so yet you know the the central bank <unk> um they released in the stability financial stability report published a few weeks ago an analysis regarding uh mpls for the entire system and uh what they did is look at information from the entire banking system for the last twenty years and they they you know using an economic model they they estimated you know where they could of variables that they determine mpls and they break down the the the loan portfolio in consumer loans in mortgage loans and corporates so uh once they they determine you know this economy a trick model then they provided uh uh you know a shock with the variables that we're seeing uh lately and they estimated how much uh mpl ratios would iterate for the entire banking system uh for consumer loans that would imply a thirty two percent increase for mortgages nineteen percent and for corporates also thirty two percent so when you do that math and you break that uh you know by the type of loans by type of bank you get to see you know this is obviously a ballpark estimate because obviously every single bank has uh different practices in uh you know origination practices and recovery and so on but you can get a sense of the magnitude in terms of you know using this model you know how much you you would expect that each bank with the with provision okay thank you thanks <unk> for the uh detail responses we will take the next question it comes from the line of <unk> from bank of america please go ahead hi good morning i'm here thanks for the opportunity uh my first question is a follow up on the preventative provisions of three point nine billion pesos so you think this level of provisions will be enough for the rest of the year or do you going to evaluate to create more depending on the behavior of payments after the relief program and then my second question is a difficult one because we would like to know if you have exposure to io mexico on the chapter level <unk> that has restructure loans with the banks for about a year but i understand if you cannot disclose your exposure so maybe if you can remind us how much of your loan book is exposed to airlines and how to food and beverage and is there is a sector that is concerning you and and finally uh my last question is some competition in mortgage loans uh we have seen different banks reducing the interest rates uh or mortgages in light of the lower rates so how has been your strategy to attract more uh mortgage clients and how competitive is your interest rate thank you thank you uh last time uh let me let me start and then uh we will uh compliment first of all of the follow-up operations like um i haven't spoken many times with to my zero and he basically tells me that uh when i asked you and ask him the same question that you're asking me at this point and he basically says look i mean i don't have a crystal ball um so clear and uh it's quite impossible i mean not impossible but it's not as difficult to assess what we're doing i mean uh what i can tell you is that we're doing our best job in in basically reviewing the portfolio uh we do that every single day we review the the behavioral bit and uh we're basically trying to be as conservative as we can in order to manage it so um and if we see that the portfolio that continues to deteriorate on is much more complicated we're gonna find out i mean the payment shock comes in the first week of august we're preparing the next week actually when the first loans that went into the paying holiday start um to to mature and uh and we see that we will see how the performance of the portfolio is and then we'll take them in you're gonna see uh our numbers uh right as uh i mean and we wanna take the provisions as soon as they come if needed okay and our second point in our mexico yes and uh and they said yes we do have uh exposure to them nothing that we cannot control or nothing too big for the size of the bank i mean our total exposure to airlines um is not big i mean compared to the total size of the portfolio i would say uh uh probably you know the percentage much better but it's uh it's it's not big i mean it's uh it's not very significant versus the size of the bank and uh we have done some prohibitions already on some of this push we have supplied to mexico okay so we can tell you that uh in the in the permissions that we made some of them are made to for for the other mexico exposure which is not relevant in terms of like yeah yes we do have a exposure to them or also no i mean not significant and uh we are basically in the restructuring process as of now and uh and we see that the company can recover uh fairly i mean i don't see that i'd say it's gonna be a particular situation for them which i don't know if video has a data unfortunately i don't have it in front of me and we can get back to you on that on that part in terms of the competition of more touch loans um it's quite important what we do uh uh we have a important differentiation in terms of how we do markets versus our competition if you take a look at what people take up lose is it's a completely different product that nobody has replicated in the mexican market i mean so the other banks basically have tried to do a little bit of what we're doing in protective loss in protective loss is the best rate available in the market but in order to get a rate based available in the market which is seven point seven five percent for a fifteen year mortgage uh you have to basically turn into turn us into your most important bank to your number bank bank number one bank what in order to able to get that right you basically have to have different products with us that basically you have to have your payroll you have to direct debit um you you deal this with us you have to have your insurance you have so there is some that you have to do in order to be able to access the rate in that we have what happens is even if the loan is at seven point seventy five and we're also very cautious in the loan to value that we do in that in that loan and that's why so i hear you i was explaining in the presentation that that's why our ticket for mortgage is thirty seven percent larger than the rest so we go directly to the more to the wealthy people okay so the people that are in the best people right now so we believe that our portfolio is more resilient in these particular situations and also that we get the best client because those are the ones that basically can achieve this rate and can achieve this and have this characteristics to access this type of product so that's why the the the portfolio we believe is gonna behave well and it's gonna be managed um or it's gonna uh behaving in a nice in a nice in a nice way due to the fact okay so and we have seen the way the portfolio have performed and we see that the performance is according to our expectations given the very complicated circumstances okay so in that regard i mean there is competition i mean there are some banks i mean a couple of banks have tried to come in and and basically compete with us have to help in these type of situations but they have not been able to have the same type of problems that we that we set to the market then we came out with a other problems that they protect every the protect every basically has a particularity that has everything included in the weight you don't have any fees any commissions you don't have to pay for any ancillary cost or anything like that so that particular thing is for people that i mean that they believe that we have a lot of things under the table and that we're not completely clear this is completely transparent to the client and that people take that is about nine percent that's the rate and the and that's for a difficult different type of client so we have a chinese menu for every type of different client that would like to access uh what we do and and for example the <unk> to a different sector that is new to all studies basically clients with a lower ticket and um well there are some of these clients that are very good and uh they have a very good credit quality and uh that's what we decided to compete in that sector i don't know if this answered your question or that please be a compliment uh sure director um regarding your first first question of mentor uh you know as as i previously mentioned uniting that it depends on the you know how severe is the gdp contraction this year you know and how that impacts the capacity for clients to to pay back their loans uh we think that uh you know as mentioned if if there's a you know like a u-type recovery and you know gdp contracting somewhere around ten to twelve percent then we have made with the provisions of this water you know more than half of what we recall and that could be you know sixty to seventy five percent of what we require you know with information that we have right now okay so but it's gonna be dependent on how these balls you know and obviously we're closely monitoring uh you know our clients are are behaving okay now on your second question regarding the exposure that we have to a mexican assay you know obviously before confidentiality reasons we cannot disclose those those but we can reassure you that these two exposures that we have are not uh within our top ten exposures uh as i mentioned we have already paid permission partially the exposure that we have with ira mexico that's close to forty five percent of the the but sure that we have that is not that the material okay and i don't have with me the breakdown in terms of food the beverage the breakdown that we have that i have right now it's more uh uh the one that the cmbv uses more for regulatory purpose i said don't don't have to not have that detail but uh for sure we can follow up with that uh i haven't seen now this is super <unk> thank you very much okay the next question comes from brian florida from city bank please go ahead uh hi good morning thank you for the opportunity to ask questions before you have my questions you wanted to make a quick follow up you mentioned that uh based on your crm capabilities you saw a certain percentage of customers continue paying uh what what does that percentage sorry sorry that's forty okay i think that's forty percent right okay forty percent thank you and amount for my question uh you know we'll see some declaration in a equality across the board and and as you mentioned um that you s and d portfolio has a large degree of guarantee what happened uh my question isn't great guys could you employ them on the collaborative there and we've not given default for from these segments what what are you expecting in terms of npl for for this segment thank you um if you like i can take that actor um the you know carry cards you know do not have a collateral you know so so laws given the faults in in in in carry cards is close to a hundred percent you know you you basically do not recover that much you know in terms of uh credit cards you know and uh you know we think that that's that's gonna be one of the products uh mostly impacted you know when you look at uh you know the some types of loans that clients have you know we think that uh mortgages are the ones that you uh you don't you know you continue paying you know if there's any just one loan that you continue pain that's that's mortgages and probably uh credit cards are uh you know at the bottom of uh your priorities you know when you have a problem you know uh the mpls that we see in in in credit cards you know have been increasingly likely but i think is you know relatively stable when you compare the you know historically you know so we don't we don't expect you know as significant uh deterioration you know uh uh you know cost of the risk you know with the uh the permissions that we're taking is close to eleven percent um so i don't know if you would like to exercise you would like to to further compliment on this this is the operator mr travis' line has gone idle i will try to reconnect them at this time would we like to take the next question the next question comes from people about that from goldman sachs hi good morning thank you for the call i'm taking a question um one question on the market related income i know you talked you know the big spike in the quarter but do you think that goes back to normal already in the third quarter or do you think that could remain elevated elevated some period of time just to get i know it's hard to predict but if you can get some more color on how would you think about market related income going forward and then if i can ask this one follow up on the provisions um you know i understand given this scenario you see you kind of feel comfortable with where you are but you know if you look at the cost of risk before this quarter it had been around two point six two point seven you know barring any changes in the scenario that you see right now is that two point six two point seven what we should expect sort of going forward as well uh again buying any significant changes in the current scenario okay thank you i mean what i can tell you is yes we have got good run in terms of market related income i think that the the banks were positioned to do so the the the important point is uh more activity and uh if volatility continues to be the way it is and then you can expect that we can um we can basically have uh good numbers there i don't think we're gonna have um in the in the in the third quarters numbers as good as they were in the in the in this quarter but i mean it was gonna depend what happens in the next relates in the next few months in terms of uh the prohibitions and the cost of uh risk did you want to comment on that absolutely uh <unk> you know i think that the the once you take out the story are there any provisions that we did this quarter i think that cost of risk should be slightly higher than the numbers that we were having over the last five quarters but not to levels that we reported the so somewhere you know below the three hundred basis points that that would be my my take you know and obviously as you mentioned you know with information that we currently have okay okay certainly that's helpful thank you we'll take the next question it comes from the line of <unk> from h s b c please go ahead <unk> um i have a question about credit risk but not to your corporate but to the version of the financial system we already saw one company that has been liquidated has been put in liquidation but the national banking commission uh this is becoming a very long crisis with ten seconds of the economy being unable to operate so eventually one would imagine that some situations might get into trouble uh i get that taking a special precautions uh um in regard to any factors of the financial system and do you think you don't come to much struggle or most of them will be able to go through this okay thank you thank you couples i mean uh i mean in all this particular city rations and depend how long the crisis is gonna take i mean it's probably gonna take down some financial players in that sense we are yes we are being very cautious and reviewing and having conversations with them about what the decision is and their situation um and we're gonna basically continue to monitor that as the crisis continues to to to avoid so in that sense uh we are very close in uh to a particular sector we don't have i mean we are not a big lender to the sector i mean uh uh i can tell you that uh if you uh they're not in there as they give a thing or they're ten most important clients they're not financial failures so in that sense we are not worried about the exposure that we have out to them but we are very cons uh taking a look and monitoring um the more the time okay hopefully the crisis shorter and nobody else goes on but i mean let's see what happens in the particular sub segment that gives him money maybe the special monitoring you know market related or control as a lady or table i think micro finance is a sector that we need to be uh very close monitoring we don't have to we don't have to s a lot of big exposures to them but that's a sector that probably would become to get it as always in this type of situations the people that suffer the most are the ones that are on the are on the base of the pyramid so fortunately that's the case and we are monitoring that <unk> thank you so much we'll take the next question it comes from alan so that's here from <unk> please go ahead good morning thank you for taking my questions my question is regarding liquidity um i mean you already created a collaboration improved nicely in the quarter in part it was already to the one point eight billion dollars that each ones in april but also given a very strong increase in funding with banks this quite so could you please provide some color as to the nature of this funding source and what would be your strategy for liquidity in the coming quarters thank you very much hi a lot of the you know there are uh several factors uh regarding uh liquidity uh you know i think that the the most relevant is are you know how we fund the uh you know the let's say the loan to the position that has been was one of the strongest the the numbers that we have reported since we became a listed company close to ninety two percent so that's that's in my opinion that's the most proposed and fundamental way of looking at it then um as you really mentioned the um the data teachers is you know contributed significantly to the increase of our uh uh liquidity coverage uh ratio and we are monitoring you know any potential use of the committed lines of credit that we have with our clients that if you look at it it's probably one uh let's say risk that could materialize in in in the short term we have ample of liquidity to honor you know every single community line of grade that uh that we have but that that's the one uh the most relevant uh driver in terms of consumption of liquidity the other types of uh you know events that could impact our liquidity you know our are you know are more gradual you know and those could be you know uh contraction in the posits that we're not seeing that um and i think that the bank has uh managed um quite prac you know uh liquidity to be prepared for you know any potential uh you know really worst case scenario further down the road thank you and regarding the line of uh in your actually the line of banks and other loans uh which increase eighty one percent quite a required do do you think this line would will remain uh close to those levels or do you think you could substitute this sort of uh sort of funding with probably other that each one is in coming quarters what's your study there you know we we monitor constantly the different type of funding sources and depending on the the specific uh you know tenure uh cost you know we end up you know withdrawing or or taking advantage of uh the uh the different from the sources so you know i would say that not only that particular line item but every single line item is is is reviewed you know uh and under current market circumstances we you know it's it's our obligation to look at that ways of uh you know not only funding the bank but you know keeping uh structures in place so that the bank you know can continue supporting uh you know longer so that's something that we continue to monitor uh alan so so yes you know it could be that we give it at those levels or that we reduce it if there's an opportunity to find you know uh a more effective uh for resource and there's this thank you very much there we'll take the next question that comes from <unk> from jp morgan please go ahead <unk> uh thank you <unk> uh i have a question regarding the increase on npi ratio uh it was a thirty five deep squirt of required uh and i understood that some peers they had hired chair jobs and that may explain a little bit uh but even on the players uh where the charge off was not as high uh we kind of saw a more flatish uh in tl behavior uh because of the special accounting because of the problem with it so one role of the situation is order for for you and my second uh question is regarding the special accounting uh criteria um when we look to those numbers um the the balance of fields are much higher than than the ones uh the old account versus the currency especially accounting and i would like to understand the difference here uh if it's like um a very negative look which you see you know like those numbers material aligners loss so if you can explain uh for me the difference is on the special accounting versus all the accounting the and it's the balance of anything of their um need need become losses i would appreciate thank you um how you uh in terms of uh the mpl ratio you know this this quarter what uh drove the delight declaration was basically a credit card that went up from four point four point fourteen percent to four point eighty two percent and the msm is basically going from two point sixty one percent to three point thirty seven percent um as as we discussed during the quarter during the call um you know the vast majority of our loan portfolio did not enroll in the in the support programs so what we're seeing you know this is like the duration has to do more with what's happening with the the portfolio of the clients that did not did not involve in the program the and it's not a significant iteration or view given you know the the you know what's going on in the economy it's it's just a you know a slight deterioration now on your second question uh could you elaborate on that you know i i don't i don't know exactly what you're comparing you know the special account criteria to the other accounting criteria so uh the the prison accounting before the same individual regulation for for covid um you have like a table uh on your release uh compared uh the special accounting criteria versus the former i think like d six uh accounting criteria and when we look to the have a small performed loans i believe the balance you have today is something around like eighteen billion players and anything billion plays that that implies the true point five percent interracial but if you look to the old accounting criteria the d six accounting uh i think the balance of tls they are closer to forty forty four billion sales so then curation they would be much higher um i understand that maybe a lot of loans that will not really become any tls they are there but my concern is that uh as soon as is a country criteria go goes back to normal if we could see you know like a a a a a higher need of provisions uh working on skills so that's why i ask the difference and if it if it makes sense you know to to expect some working on that you know i think that that uh you know it it's fairly dependent on the level of or the type of assumptions that we make because uh the the existing accounting criteria is very stringent in terms of uh uh let's say uh path tools and percentage of uh uh you know how much you you know the client has paid back so i think that it's it's uh in my opinion it's it's somehow uh extreme uh comparison okay so it it has to do with you know um with the um a special accounting criteria you basically allow clients not to pay you know every client that's not paying their interest in capital it stays current you know and uh uh under the all the or the trailing accounting criteria you know you have to take into account just the the uh you know when when your ninety days pass do and depending on if you are you know let's say uh uh a corporate client you know depending on how much you have already paid back whether you're twenty percent or or more or how you know the time that has lapsed you know uh it uh it uh you know it's it's very i would say uh the critical i would say that assumptions are critical and i think that uh probably what it's uh what it's important is to understand that in the following two quarters we'll get to know the the hard data you know we uh you know rather than uh you know comparing those numbers with the big ass i think that as soon as clients start paying back or not we get to know you know how you know the magnitude of the impact okay rather than just making you know some assumptions that you you know could materialize or not as as mentioned during the call i think that uh uh we have made we have made a good assessment in terms of the risk that each client has you know the relationship that we have with them and we have also asked them you know you know how they're doing and whether they have the capacity to pay back so taking all that into account that's how we we've we come up with these uh uh prohibitions associated with the specific losses that uh go so so i would i would encourage you usually just to wait a couple of quarters and with the with the heart data you know just analyze you know if we you know on one hand the benefit of this temporary measure that the banking commission provided and on the other hand you know the the the true impact that it has had in our asset quality no thank you very much we will take the next question it comes from nicole <unk> from bank of america yes thank very much for taking my question i got one question i apologize if you already mentioned it i um uh so you you mentioned that nineteen percent of the of the loan portfolio um has been subject to some kind of that we need to measure payment holidays even great period um have these measures ended or ready for any client and if so if you can tell us um what's the percentage of this client uh that have received um statements or where it seems extreme or really about the four months in the full outbreak of the pandemic and and it this has not been the case the payment quality hasn't tended for for any significant amount of clients if you can tell that when you make this this provision charge or the three point nine billion cases in this quarter um do you incorporate any assumption um in terms of what would be the percentage of this nineteen percent of these clients and the value program that we'll send you back once the payment holiday um ends thank you you know first the payment holidays uh payment holiday period and uh tomorrow so we'll start the uh you know seeing whether clients payback or not uh you know starting next week so we don't have that information yet no now regarding you know how we uh made permissions for uh for this quarter know and as mentioned throughout the call you know we classified um the clients depending on the risk that they have um the exposure that they have with us the relationship that have they have with us so we we classify the you know greater clients in twenty five clusters and sms in eleven clusters so depending on the level of uh of cluster that each uh client falls in you know there's either a high risk or high exposure category you know for clients and we assume certain probability of those closers either paying back their loans or not okay so that's how we came up with with the with the provision that uh we we made this water so yes there's but it depends you know there are thirty six responses in terms of you know whether they respect a high no for a loan number of clients to pay back the loans it's it it you know it's it's because of these analysis that we've done that we feel a relatively confident that with the information that we have what we have provided is is is is good uh you a good provision for asset quality declaration for the rest of the year okay thank you very much the next question comes from <unk> from ubs please go ahead okay thank you very much for taking my question it is just one i just wanted to understand the dynamic of the credit relief program held by the bank and the high call on npls to two point five percent uh according to my calculation uh the first loans reach at almost fifteen percent of total loans if i'm not wrong uh i i roughly a similar level to the other banks but different from other players and even consider in the brazil and the children of subsidiaries uh they have a house of foster their currently problem npls decrease it in the second queue uh uh you mentioned that this deterioration is from the sme and the credit card segment so i just wanted to understand if this hiking npls behaved worse than expected by the bank considering the amount of loans that work was owned and what does the bank uh see for this semester in terms of foster in the credit release problem in case of regulators uh extend the schedule and change the rules for it so thank you very much no i think that you know uh the first of all you know the m else that they increase that we see in the second quarter i also see that with those clients that do not enter into the uh relief program okay so it has to do with that eighty one percent of clients that decided not to enter into into the program and obviously those clients are also exposed to the the declaration of economic activity you know uh the actor mentioned you know the the the uh losses that the you know the employee losses that we've seen um so it's it has to do more with that okay with the let's say with the clients that do not enroll in the program okay and whether we were expecting uh you know that type of situation you know i think that if someone tells you that they were envisioning this type of economic situation i think that they're lying you know i think that we uh we were not expecting this type of uh uh contraction you know the magnitude that we are seeing you know if you look at how every single uh uh analyst updates is uh a forecast for the mexican economy every week you get to see the downward adjustments so so i think that it do not for prices you know we mentioned that given this this situation of uh economic activity we think it's just a slight deterioration okay um the uh but as mentioned we will get to see the final impact uh or the the numbers probably the next two to three quarters you know it's not only you know what happens the rest of the year i think that this the impact of the pandemic at least for mexico has a possibility of you know going further than just the twenty twenty so we will get to see that okay i think it's it's uh quite early to to have a definitive view on a complete impact on on asset right okay okay thank you very much the last question comes from because of <unk> from btg textual please go hi everyone my questions were already answered thank you very much there are no further questions in the queue and i'd like to turn the floor back over to mr <unk> for any closing remarks thank you operator and thanks everyone once again for joining september mexico on this call there's always we wish to maintain an open dialogue with all of you in the financial community so if you have additional additional questions please don't hesitate to call or email us directly until our next call please stay safe good afternoon this concludes today's teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you again
