ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by and welcome to the conference call to discuss the definitive agreement for illumina to acquire grail at this time all participants are in a listen only mode after the speaker's presentation that there will have a question and answer session to ask a question during this session you'll need to press star one on your telephone keypad you will be limited to one question if you require any further assistance please press star zero thank you i'd like to hand the conference over to your moderator for today jackie ross vp of administer relations please go ahead good morning everyone and thanks for joining us on such short notice to discuss the defendant's agreement for illumina to acquire graham if you've not had a chance to release data with it can be found in the investor relations section of our website at illumina dot com participating for illumina today will be prompted to sue the president and chief executive officer and samsama chief financial officer we're also pleased to welcome handfish of grail's chief executive officer process hands and sam will share some prepared remarks and then we will open the call for some questions this call is being recorded and the audio portion will be archived in the investor section of our website today's presentation contains estimates projections and other forward looking statements these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties actually events or results may differ materially from those projected or discussed please review the closing statement and there are important information for investors and stockholders on slide two with that i'll turn the call over to francis thanks jackie good morning everyone and thank you for joining us on such short notice i'm excited to share that very year this morning we announced an agreement to acquire grail and to work together to launch a new era in cancer detection before we start i want to acknowledge the grail team for what they've accomplished we spent out grail four years ago to focus on an ambitious goal to revolutionize the way we detect cancer by developing a blood test that could find cancer earlier than is possible today their innovation and results since then have exceeded even our lofty expectations setting stage for early cancer detection to likely be the largest genomic application over the next fifteen years by far this combination will be transformative for cancer detection the acquisition will enable to leverage illumina's global commercial clinical and operations capabilities accelerating their mission and allowing us to impact more people faster than they might have done alone illumina's next generation sequence will continue to support genomic medicine to become standard of care across clinical applications and with this acquisition we will accelerate and participate more fully and directly in the highest value clinical opportunity enabled by our technology specifically the acquisition positions of luna to participate in what we expect will be a seventy five billion dollar market for ngs based oncology tests by twenty thirty five sixty billion higher than our oncology at times excluding graham cancer is one of the greatest threats to human health despite the significant investments made and the important medical advancements achieved so far when we diagnose cancer too late when it is metastatic less than twenty percent of patients will survive more than five years in contrast if we diagnose cancer early approximately ninety percent of patients are expected to survive beyond five years about seventy one percent of cancer related deaths are attributable to cancers with no recommended screening tests and with limited screening tests cancer is more likely to be detected in the late stages and or more often than not too late this is both a human tragedy and an enormous burden on the healthcare system each year there are over six hundred thousand cancer related deaths in the us and approximately ten million deaths worldwide making it the second in cause of death we spend approximately two hundred fifty billion per year on cancer in the us and globally the economic the annual economic impact is more than one point two trillion dollars and now for the first there is a technology platform that enables us to address this burden starting with grails multi cancer detection test gallery which aims to reduce cancer tests by transforming how and when cancer is detected grails technology characterizes the dna that cancer cells shed into the blood detecting unique signatures that identify both the presence and often the tissue of origin of the cancer earlier this year grail shared positive results from its circulating cell free genome atlas or ctga study that has enrolled fifteen thousand participants the study found that the first version of gallery reported sensitivity of forty four percent for stage one through three tumors for fifty different cancers and sixty seven percent sensitivity for the twelve deadliest cancers and in ninety three percent of the positive results the test correctly identified the tissue of origin all with a specificity of greater than ninety nine percent and from a single blood draw arguably one of the most important performance measures for doctors and payers is the positive predictive value for ppv which is the percentage of positive tests that actually cancers for gallery we predict a ppv of forty three percent this represents the very significant step forward compared to today's most commonly used screening tests which often have a ppv in the range of three to five percent the gray team is preparing to launch gallery as a lab developed test for ldt in twenty twenty one we believe that this is a remarkable advance in the ability to detect cancer earlier which can transform cancer care and improve population health as noted earlier most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half the slide checks the limitations of current screening methods lead to only thirty one percent of cancers being identified into ages one and two when they're the most treatable based on grail studies this could increase to eighty two percent with broad adoption of galleries blood test complimenting today's recommended cancer screening this matters because if we mentioned earlier survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected broader option of gallery could avert nearly forty percent of the five year cancer mortality or around one hundred thousand debts annually in the us my apologies for the technical issues we will pick up again from five earlier most cancers are currently diagnosed in late stages as shown by the gray bars in the chart on the left half of slide six the limitations of current screening methods lead to only thirty one percent of cancers being identified in stages one them two when they're most treatable based on grade studies this can increase to eighty two percent with broader option of galleries blood tests complementing today's recommended screening this matters because as we mentioned earlier survival rates are directly correlated with how early cancer is detected broader adoption of gallery could avert nearly forty percent of the five year cancer mortality or around one hundred thousand deaths annually in the u to put this in perspective it's roughly matches the number of deaths prevented by all current screening testing treatment and surgery standards combined once available we're confident that will enable screening for more cancers than ever before while screening has improved for some cancers including lung breast colorectal and cervical we know that roughly six and ten cancers diagnosed from twelve million cases and five million invest a year are associated with cancers with no recommended sweeting requirements since gallery will help discover cancer earlier we believe that gallery can help detect three times as many cancers when added to recommended single cancer screenings there's significant opportunity to improve outcomes for patients and the potential impact in families and communities highlights the importance of sales work we will also be able to better meet the needs of healthcare provide and delivery systems by improving the overall efficiency of cancer detection payers will be able to realize the lower cost associated with the treatment of cancer at earlier stages based on grilled estimates the adoption of gi alongside existing screening guidelines could help reduce diagnostic workup costs by up to sixty five percent these benefits are key drivers in the market potential which we anticipate reflection addresses market for ngs based oncology testing of seventy five billion today we're seeing rapid adoption of ngs based therapy selection tests many based on illumina's technology over the next fifty years we expect this market to grow in a category of about sixteen percent to fourteen million to an annual seven million test opportunity at approximate asc of thirteen hundred to twenty three hundred dollars a little bit of participants in the therapy selection market with our tso five hundred tests currently available for research use owning and making its way through regulatory approval for commercial launch in early twenty twenty two as the reimbursement landscape continues the strengths and drives utilization of therapy selection tests we're seeing more companies working on monitoring tests that will assess the activity of a patient's cancer this can optimize disease management and determining effectiveness of the cancer therapies for individual patients these assays can also act a surveillance test for cancer patients who have completed therapy and are in remission we expect this market to grow with a cancer of about twenty seven percent to fifteen billion in twenty thirty five the test opportunity here is expected to grow to about twenty million tests per year with an expected asb of seven hundred to a thousand dollars the cancer screening opportunity it's significantly larger and therapy selection and monitoring combined this market is expected to grow quickly to about a hundred and fifty million tests in twenty thirty five a seventy five percent to a per absolutely forty six billion dollars this assumes an asb that starts around twelve hundred dollars and trends to about three hundred dollars in twenty thirty five as we scale and drive adoption with increasingly accessible pricing in regards to the market for galleries specifically there is a sizable addressable market of over one hundred million people between the age of fifty to seventy nine in the us we believe approximately half of this addressable market it's accessible with gallery prior to reimbursement the grant go to market strategy next year will consist to three core channels health systems self-insured employers and concierge medicine given the cost improvement potential we feel that health system and self-insured employers will recognize the compelling value propositions and drive adoption of the first multi cancer detection ldt available there's also an opportunity in constant our medicine segment that typically caters to health conscious members that like to be on the forefront of new medical technologies who could be early adopters of gallery we expect that grail the launch gallery is twenty twenty one with a four to additional results next year from the ccga stuff study three pathfinder to further support the clinical validation of gathering additionally grant will continue to work on its diagnostic aid for cancer tests our deck which is intended for symptomatic patients and is designed to speed up the time to diagnosis when cancer is suspected and gray also has a minimal residual disease or mrd test in development intended for patients who have been diagnosed and treated to detect persistent disease following definitive therapy on that note i'd like to invite him the ceo of grail to say a few words thank you francis i'm excited to be here today let me start by recognizing the accomplishments of the grail team we're a mission-driven company focused on detecting cancer early when it can be cured when we believe our early cancer detection to techno could substantially reduce the burden of cancer worldwide could it develop a new technology that preferentially targets the most informed regions of the genome and uses machine learning algorithms to do attack the presence of cancer and identify the tumors tissue of origin we believe by joining forces of illumina will achieve scale faster preventing more late stage cancer diagnosis we are strongly positioned with our first two commercial product launches expected in twenty twenty one and once ideal closes we'll be able to leverage the global scale and reach the lumina through relationships and in country infrastructure to further our commercialization efforts simply put sales mission and focus will not change but illumina's international footprint and expertise across market access regulatory can affairs and manufacturing will accelerate our ability to realize our mission and goal to improve patient outcomes we've built a world-class team of data and computer scientists at the forefront of applying ai to genomics and we're better to serve or leverage those capabilities for the benefit of human health than <unk> in the process we've also established an impressive ip portfolio with more than two hundred and first the patent grounded globally and another a hundred and seventy pending patent applications with a hundred and fifteen thousand participants enrolled and another thirty thousand planned rail has built a one of the largest population scale clinical trial programs ever pursued in genomic medicine grills genomic database continues to grow with each test and additional clinical trial participant and today stands out over twelve point six petabytes worth of genomic data the comparison is five times larger than the cancer genome atlas illumina remains the most innovative companies and great ability to keep pushing the boundaries of what possible is what's possible to keep finding more and more cancers at earlier stages will be further strengthened as a result of this combination having spent time with this is the illumina team i'm confident we all shared the same goal and we're committed to accelerating our mission and delivering on our promise faster than could be done alone we both believe this is a case where one plus one will equal well over two and with that i'd like to hand call back to process nice and i couldn't be more excited about the opportunity to work with the grail team to accelerate adoptions of their life saving process by leveraging our global commercial clinical and operations capabilities our global commercial organization market sales and support only sixty six hundred customers in a hundred and fifteen countries including a number of national population scale genomics programs powered by illumina sequencing technology illumina first established our clinical lab in two thousand and nine and since then added two more including one in the uk to support genomics england and the nhs be certified and accredited labs are staffed by more than two hundred and fifty team members including board certified pathologists medical geneticists genetic counselors and phd the scientists over the last five years our labs have processed more than seventeen million areas and almost one million clinical samples we've also expanded our clinical capabilities and built out world-class market access government affairs and regulatory functions in addition our clinical grade development and manufacturing teams deliver systems and kids registered for ibd use in more than thirty five country around the world now at the same time we've been extending our reach into the clinical market through partnerships with leading clinical companies including bms carbon and roche as illumina and grail come together we accelerate adoption of clinical ndm based testing this will have a positive impact in our business over time more of our revenue will reflect the clinical value of our ngs products and not only the underlying sequencing aspect as a result illumina will play a direct role in operating the adoption of genomic medicine in addition to enabling it as we evolve lumina remains committed to all of our customers and partners we're dedicated to delivering the most innovative sequencing sequencing systems and consumable to our customers and partners there's still so much important research to be done and we know this will be enabled in part by continued innovation and sequencing and on the clinical side our mission has always been improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome we will continue to enable our clinical customers to scale as they do work towards the shared goal with that let me hand things over to sam for a quick review of financial term and that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's announced earlier today we have agreed to acquire drill for a total pass and stop consideration of eight billion dollars with additional payments length of certain product sales for the first five years this acquisition expands illumina's market opportunity by more than sixty billion dollars it allows us to participate in the clinical market more fluid and will contribute to revenue growth starting honestly in twenty twenty one and meaningfully accelerate over time we expect the transaction flows in the second half of twenty twenty one and we will share more detailed expectations about revenue growth and impact on eps when that happens national stock consideration is eight billion dollars since illumina currently owns twelve percent of grails equity on a fully included base the purchase price goes approximately seven billion dollars to grails other shareholders as part of the transaction illumina will say brail shareholder is approximately four billion dollars in common stock which is subject to a collar the number of shares issued based on the tiny trait volume weighted average price of illumina common stock ten days prior to close moreover the stock consideration collar ensures the final number of shares that grail shareholders receive is derived from a price that will be within a share price band a few hundred ninety five dollars and three hundred ninety nine dollars the remaining three point one billion cash consideration is expected to be funded with balance sheet cash and up to an additional one billion dollars raised even it through equity or debt we have a one million dollars fully committed rich fund with goldman sachs sure of funding availability the last component of the needle includes contingent payment rights to grail shareholders they on grail or later for news for a twelve year period specifically a two point five percent payment right is applied to the first one billion dollars of revenue each year and all revenue about that would be subject to a nine percent payment right to grail share with that that's great thank you sam when we created grail in twenty sixteen we knew that its mission was the moonshots but an important one one that would have significant ramifications for the section of cancer is successful positively impacting millions of lives and opening a massive market opportunity we wanted to see the technology progress as fast as possible creates the largest clinical trials and get it patients in years not decade it was clear that the best way to do this and capitalize the effort was as a separate company with this singular focus and an extraordinary team that could execute quickly illumina set it up for six by seeing it with technology and some of our best and brightest four years later grail has proven the skeptics wrong and is now at the pre-commercial stage it was a big bet and it paid off over the last four and a half years grail has raised almost two billion dollars to fund its mission during the same period illumina generator about four billion dollars in ebitda grail's mission is no longer a moonshot and we believe this poised to transform cancer detection our mission at illumina is to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome that hasn't changed in over the last twenty three years we began our journey by launching our micro ray based services and products are very clear rays offered higher throughput lower costs more flexibility and higher quality than existing technologies and we became the leading micro ray vendor by two thousand and six more than doubling rather years from the previous year while we enjoyed the success we saw the opportunity to take the next step forward towards our vision through sequencing array towards going away and in twenty twenty we still have an array business but we saw the potential so for enormous and very elastic research market required by high quality lower cost sequencing so in two thousand six we acquired some extra a sequencing technology company with no revenue for six hundred million dollars at the heard of our market gap at the time the market was initially skeptical we began the race to the thousand dollars genome and over the last fourteen years the vision is proved right we reduced the cost of high quality sequencing of a genome from a hundred and two thousand dollars in two thousand and seven to six hundred dollars today enabling groundbreaking genomic discoveries including circulating fetal dna maternal blood and the impact of rare variants on cancer therapy response by two twenty fourteen when we delivered the industry's first thousand dollars genome a research sequencing business with thriving and once again we sent we were entering a new era of genomics entering the clinic in twenty thirteen we acquired <unk> a provider of non invasive prenatal testing in december twenty thirteen we received the first ever fda authorization for our next generation sequencer we embarked on our own multi-year clinical transformation building out the capabilities i referenced earlier today our clinical business therapy selection and oncology n i c t and genetic disease testing account for half of our sequencing consumable revenues we're now entering the next phase of genomics sequencing is this standard of care early cancer detection represents the largest genomics application by far we believe over the next decade because cancer screening impacts a very large part of the population it enters in an era where regular genomic testing is the norm for a population we accelerate this mission by acquiring grails before we open up to q and a i wanna summarize a few things first excluding grail for a moment and remains confident in our business and excited by the opportunity ahead we expect to continue as the leading innovator in sequencing supporting both research and clinical customers gray is not replacing anything and as such the acquisition will be added to illuminate opportunity and growth we consider early cancer detection to be one of the largest clinical opportunities of the next fifteen years and we believe it will accelerate global adoption by participating more directly set in this acquisition is consistent our strategy to extend into the clinical market the fastest growing opportunity in sequencing will continue to deliver sequencing systems and consumables and remain committed to the relentless pursuit of sequencing innovate that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's the mission over time now that they stand point to bring products to market in twenty twenty one we believe this is the right time to bring the grail team into illumina so that we can help to commercialize and accelerate the in closing our mission to improve human health by unlocking the power of the genome and grail's mission to detect cancer early when it can be cure could not be more consistent we look forward to accelerating the age of genomic medicine together with that i'll advise the operator to begin the q and a certainly at this time if you'd like to ask a question please press star one again you will be limited to one question doug <unk> with kelly your line is open good morning um so so grail is clearly a really exciting and promising asset and you did a great job this morning outlining uh a lot of that um and you were very comprehensive and explaining uh why you wanna do this deal i'm i'm actually hoping that you could address how you got comfortable overcoming some of the reasons not to do the deal these include three things that would be really helpful for you to address the first is the challenge of competing with customers which has been an issue for you in the past and something you talk about avoiding so i'm first off wondering how you expect to manage that and why the change why the pivot there seconds the dilution associated with this deal which could create a potential internal pnl conflict when it comes to incentive structure not to mention an issue with investor valuation methodologies i think this is part of the reason your stock got hit so much last week in anticipation of this announcement so how do you handle potential pnl conflict internally and externally moving forward and then third the lack of clear clinical operating center um and and how you plan to succeed as a clinical development company in a way that you haven't in the past we know that illumina is great at certain things especially developing leading genetic tools platforms and having an opinion a commercial team in place to support not just the placement of these platforms but how users use them that said well you've been great as an arms dealer to clinical customers your track record isn't as strong when it comes to developing and selling out and getting them through regulatory and reimbursement pathways so so what are the clinical synergies and how do you quantify them again one how do you manage competing with customers to how do you manage the pnl conflict internally and externally and third why should we get excited about this given the lack of clear clinical operating synergies thank you sure thank you jack so let's go through each of those the first one is how do we manage the challenge of competing our customers and our strategy there continues to be that in the vast majority of applications uh in the markets that we serve we will look to our customers and our partners to develop the applications and our sequencers and consumers and that's gonna be true with the vast majority of apple locations what we said however is that for a very small set of applications where we felt the market was large and we felt that there was a differentiated offering that we could put into the market then we would uh we would tend to that market directly in those markets we still enable our customers and partners to create competing offering so we continue to support everybody but we said in the very large markets where we felt we had a differentiated capability to bring into the market we would enter those you've seen us do that for example in the ipt space where we brought innovations and intellectual property into that market and i've put together an end-to-end solution you saw us do that in the large cancer panels like the five hundred gene panel and so five hundred now you're seeing do that here in this case we feel that the criteria we use have been met this is a very large application for us we think that over the next fifteen years it could potentially be the largest genomics application in the market in terms of addressable market size and the gray team has put together a very differentiated offering there's a lot of innovation a lot of ip that was created and talked about the two hundred and thirty applications that patents have been granted and a hundred and seventy more that have been filed and so it's a very differentiated offering and in this case you know with grails pioneering the market you know they're sort of leading the way and creating that market and so as we looked at the market we felt it meets the criteria for one of the very small set of markets that we would get into directly we're gonna continue though to enable our customers and partners to create their own offerings in this market too so that's how we thought about you know that question the next question was around delution and how we that comfortable with that and how we to manage pnl conflict and so the thinking here is that we're gonna manage grail as a as a separate division and we're gonna report uh really transparent about uh the pnl of grail and we would manage that differently and separately from the pnl for the rest of the business and we understand the profile of what it'll take to guest grill successful in the market going forward and so we'll be kind of be very transparent about you know what that low it's like you know we expect that to be dilutive for the next few years but then because of the size of the opportunity we expect it to be on the accretive as this as we start to scale the offering in the later years and again we'll be very transparent about sharing what that looks like long term we have a high confidence in the the p and l attractiveness of this business but we do know it takes investment in the first few years and the next question was about you know clinical synergies so what are the synergies that you know girls need way coming into illumina and as you know we've been building out our clinical capabilities since two thousand twenty thirteen and so today for example you know we have uh a number of places where we think gra uh grail could benefit you know as to that they come in uh some things we talked about in the call most for example that we're engaged with over fifty population sequencing efforts around the world uh today we're talking to them about uh oncology therapy selection genetic disease diagnosis uh we think it's a very natural ads to expand the conversation to include uh you know cancer screening authority detection we think that'll be very valuable in the conversations we're in and so we'll be able to immediately scale up the number of conversations that grail is having around the world we talked about our clinical labs uh we have among the largest uh clinical genomics labs in the world we have uh during the us one in the uk those labs have already processed over a million clinical samples and build the workflows and and x expertise necessary to do that and then we've also built uh you know the regulatory capabilities the market access capabilities the in country surveillance capabilities to support clinical offerings around the world today we have i needs that are cleared in thirty five countries around the world leveraging relationships we've built with the regulatory bodies in those countries as well as having in market service surveillance capabilities in those countries and you can see that playing out in the success of products that we buy on the market like our very second i p t product which is c i v d mart and doing really well in emea so those are some of the clinical capabilities that frankly we spent the last five plus years building that grail plugs into immediately your next question comes from title peterson with jp morgan your line is open hey thanks uh a couple quick ones so you know your your stock lost twenty billion of market cap west last week is doug uh alluded to you know did that influence your thinking and what is it that you think the street doesn't fully understand here you know especially given this is a pretty significant i think about a four billion dollar step up since the last round grail did in may and why is buying it all now the right approach given that you could have taken your equity stake up higher of it at forty fifty percent help the ipo and then you know had a call option of it later so that's the first question second on margins can you give us a sense of where cogs can go you know we know you have off the shelf technology for a hundred dollars genome so how much of this is about driving down cogs quickly where do you think they can go uh and then how much do you think graham needs to spend on r and d in the salesforce ramp uh to to really scale up third you know francis you talked about uh you know uh confidence in in the core business you know i think one of the things you know veterans is gonna worry out is is you know uh you know concerns about growth in the core business and maybe you know you're doing this deal to diversify and cover up you know continue to slow down so can you maybe talk to what you think about the core business for next year a little bit more quantitatively and then lastly you know other for francis or hans you know why is the forty four percent sensitivity for a screen test you know of clinical value especially at the price point's being talked about thank you thank you <unk> all right uh a lot of ground to cover so i'm gonna start by talking about your first question which is the why now question and then sam i'm gonna turn it over to you to talk about the margins question and then i'll come back and talk about you know our core business and then uh and then i'll look to to you guys maybe i'll comment a little bit the the screening tests and the clinical value so let's start um so why now um and and and did was there any sort of reaction in our minds they're asking around the stock drop that had the class group so the reason before why now and frankly we took a longer term view so the events of last week didn't really impact our why now decision uh and i'll i'll talk about that a little bit but the reason for why now is uh frankly the terrific progress that the gray team has made eight over the last few years and where they stand right now when we spent out grill four years ago you'll remember how this idea got started right so we were processing samples for n i p t and our clinical labs and although we were seeing normal uh you know fetal dna we noticed abnormalities and the mother's dna and so we reported that to the doctor and in all of those cases it turned out that the mother had cancer and didn't know about it and so we intubated so there was a was an idea that that you could get signal for cancer in the blood and we incubated that idea with our team for a couple of years to feel like there was something there but there was a lot of unknown you know it was unclear whether there was enough signal to expect early stage cancer it was unclear whether you could just detect only certain types of cancer it was unclear if the approach we were thinking about was the right approach and so what we wanted was to create a company that was going after this this this moonshot mission that we focused on the move quickly on that but we also wanted to know maybe other approaches in the market would would be more fruitfully the team has done a fantastic job over the last four years and sort of deal with a lot of the questions the the technology they put the together the team data assembled and then probably most importantly the results their demonstrating from their large scale central studies have put to bed a lot of the questions that we had you know the the gallery results i talked about based on the ccg samples show that you know they are able to identify over fifty fifty types of cancer that they have a specificity that that means the false of many nine percent is a false positive rate of less than one percent so they won't flood you know health their systems with false positives um and they have high sensitivity especially for the deadliest cancers and so they stand today on the presence of commercializing a product next year and so now now it makes a lot of sense right to acquire them and so why acquire them you asked why not just increase our investment and the reason to acquire them is because we have very clear line of sight into how we can accelerate the plan that they are on today and we can only do that they're part of illumina plugging them into our commercial conversations with population sequencing efforts for example standing them up in our clinical labs around the world rather than wait for them to build up their own clinical labs plugging into our regulatory to their case in countries around the world all of those things are things that we can do if they're part of illumina that frankly we wouldn't be able to do as well even if we were a thirty forty percent owner of of grail and so you know they are you know they they talk about long think the product next year is the post commercialization so it's exactly the right time we felt where there is a product you know the value has been demonstrated and they're ready to scale and that's where we can help from an operational perspective from a clinical perspective from a commercial in terms of the stock drop you know uh we've seen before and i mentioned this in my prepared remarks that this is a big step i understand that this is also a big amount i understand that and you know we've we've had this happen to the or when we were in the array business and we wanted to get into sequencing and we announced that we were acquiring selecta to get into the sequencing business uh our stock dropped that day too and and it took a while for us to work with which the market took explain where we were going and why we thought that was a big opportunity and and of course you know today that's been an enormously successful story and sequencing is the vast majority of our revenues and so you know we anticipated that there'd be work for us to do in explaining this step and explaining the opportunity and explaining why grail and why grail and illumina and that's the work we have in front of us but we're very confident that it's the right next step in terms of fulfilling our mission with that i'm gonna turn it over sam to you to talk about margins and the questions yeah so i'll tackle a couple of things here margins and i think you had a question on operating expenses as well taco so uh you know from an overall cog standpoint uh the cogs will initially start out you know obviously much higher and our average costs driven by the fact that you know volumes are ramping up so initially you're gonna see a higher cost profile for the business as the volume start ramping up though and two and a half to three years post launch of gallery the cost start to get to a level which is commensurate with our overall services business and uh slightly below our overall cost profile and uh obviously as we introduce more innovations and you know uh lower the cost of sequencing to your question uh the copies will benefit from that as well it's just like our all of our customers will benefit from that um in terms of operating expenses you know if you look at um what um uh what the grail invested last year or the here i should for the first one it was roughly a hundred thirty five million dollars if you extrapolate that for the full year let's say it's um you know it's exactly double that it's about two hundred seventy million for the full year as we look forward obviously that number is gonna grow because we're gonna be ramping and launching uh products we're gonna be accelerating the commercialization efforts and building out a sales sport uh and there's gonna be continuing r and d as well so you know opex especially in three years is is gonna be uh you know i have back on delusion you know but uh let me remind you of the just the attractiveness of this opportunity longer term and eventually as the volume scale uh the the opportunity is significant on the top line and even though it requires investments in terms of commercial efforts in r and d you know we will definitely uh after a few years start to see a creation on pnl and then uh maybe hans can you comment on the the cool value and then the questions are on the screening test and where we are sure so as you as you noted tyco um the uh sensitivity for fifty cancers is forty four percent so let me explain why we think this is way through performance um france has touched on the fact that when we pre-specified a basket of twelve cancers we have sensitivity of just under uh seventy percent and those twelve cancers by the way account for about two thirds of mortality um what you're observing is when you start looking for more cancers than those twelve and you start adding in cancers where the test has lower sensitivity the sensitivity does drop but here's what matters even though the sensitivity drops as you expand the absolute number of cancers you look for the total number of cancers you detect goes up so a test looking for fifty cancers at forty four percent sensitivity in aggregate detects many more cancers and a test looking for twelve cancers at a sixty seven percent and when you think about the medical need we all have you know seventy percent of death in this country from cancer occur in cancers where there is no screening this test will detects the vast majority of those so so that that's why it's the right thing to have a test that can really detect the maximum number of cancers possible great thank you and then your last question title was you know is this move any reflection of how we think about the core market and is that what's driving this and i think not at all we remain confident in our core market you know obviously this year in the last couple of quarters we've seen uh slow down because the people shows are in place as a result of the pandemic but we thought we've talked about how that slowly been been building uh since the end of q1 and you know next year certainly as we start to see a number of initiatives kick back up we feel very good about where we are with the core business we talked about the population efforts that all of us is gonna be starting in the back half of this year in the us but we'll be wrapping up next year similarly the uk biobank project has been going and paul for a little bit but it's starting to scale up again uh and then uh and the nhs effort which this year has been uh sideline to focus on on covid is gonna be kicking back up next year so we we are optimistic about where population sequencing efforts are gonna be starting into next year we've seen good news in terms of uh guideline changes for n i p t and continued growth and n i p t around the world uh we're seeing continued adoption of our tso five hundred product and we expect that to con to drive growth and then obviously we launched the next six two thousand this year and so we expect to continue to see that upgrade cycle play out certainly as we get into next year this move is really about our strategy and our strategy has been the and guided by our missions to improve human health by unlocking the part of the genome our strategy is to provide sequencers and consumables to a to a broad area of markets and then to pick very specific applications where we want to provide the solution solution ourselves we wanna pick the largest market opportunities where we can provide a differentiated offering and frankly if you look at that criteria there probably is no other criteria no other space that meets that criteria as well as early cancer detection it's the largest of the genomic applications that we can imagine over the next fifteen years and grail has built a a very innovation rich portfolio with good ip around it and so we will have a differentiated offering in that market and so the chris again the strategy is you know horizontally provide sequences into everywhere and then be very surgical and that's very common for platform companies certainly if you look at you know in technology whether it's apple or amazon or microsoft they provide the platform but then there are specific applications that they provide directly themselves typically the largest applications and having an application actually gives you access to insights that have you created that platform too so having specific applications also helps you have the best platforms in the market so with that we'll go to the next question certainly as a reminder please limit yourself to one question to allow others an opportunity derek debron with bank of america your line is open um hi good morning so a couple of questions um i guess the first one how much of illumina's revenues in two thousand nineteen and estimated revenues for two thousand twenty we're tied to sales to grail number one uh number two uh a number of questions from investors this morning just wanting to get some better clarity on the eps solution is a twenty to thirty percent uh eps to a reasonable number for the for investors to sort of do their models and number three what do you expect from the pathfinder trial read out and what would be a what would be a good read out to uh enable the ldt launch and just some initial thoughts on the uh early commercialization efforts and and what conversations grail has had with potential um uh self-insured employers and sort of the other members that you talked about thank you sure so three questions i'll take the first one around uh grail revenue to illumina in the last couple of years uh maybe sam you can talk about eps solutions and then hand so you can uh enter the push around the pathfinder read average um so first one is sort of short uh in twenty nineteen and twenty twenty grill was a very very very very small part of our overall revenue um in fact i typically look at our top twenty customers on a daily and weekly basis i don't think i ever saw them in either of those two years on those lists so it's a very small part of our revenue for twenty nineteen or twenty um that maybe uh e p s yeah so uh as i talked about earlier the the ramp of office in the a few years is significant driven by the commercialization of gallery so our expectations right now is that in the first full year post close of the deal that uh there would be ps solution of somewhere in the uh three twenty five to three seventy five dollars range and then uh tents could you talk to me a little bit about scotch fine there and the upcoming read out and place that in context a little bit and folks that aren't familiar pathfinder is a six thousand patient clinical trial that's enrolling as we speak it's a return of result study so patients in this trial getting the great test when the tester takes a cancer they're getting worked up and obviously the results return to them so our expectation is that that real world trial will will confirm the performance we seen in other studies that we've reported to and covered on the call this morning the other thing that this study is very important for is it will help us understand the service components of the test that will provide uh to help make sure that the workup process post-positive test is is simple and good to use for primary care doctors thank you all right good next question patrick conley with city your line is open great thanks guys uh maybe just to follow up on derek there just given the delusion number a little bit bigger than we were modeling uh visit the news came out last week and can you just talk about maybe the opex trajectory over the next twelve months again to get to that uh three fifty three seventy five number you noted um you know should we expect that number to really take a big jump up from what we saw on the s one from the from the um the grail opex number and then maybe just quickly after that you guys were obviously participating with an upside from the royalty as a customer et cetera so can you just expand a little more francis on i guess why you guys wanted to bring it in house and then also give the royalty almost back to them with a nine percent over a billion um there's just kind of flush that out a little bit thanks good yeah so i can start on the uh on the opex trajectory and uh maybe expanding on the solution to some extent and i'll i'll remind everybody that we will be providing more uh refined finding initial estimates as we um as we get closer uh to uh close of the acquisition so at this point we're giving you know directional numbers just to give you a sense of of what they're expecting your models uh but uh to answer your question around the effects investment patrick yes uh obviously there will be an increase from you know what you saw on the s one and what you saw last year or this year sorry i keep saying last year but what you saw this year in terms of investment by grill you know the investment has been uh focused on our r and d and as i said you know the investment that uh was disclosed was a hundred and thirty five million so if you expect that that's gonna um you know be a full year worth of investment that's closer to two seventy but as you look forward and as gallery launches there's gonna be investments around the number are effective you know it's gonna be r and d it's gonna be commercial it's gonna be market access government affairs uh you know dna to support the business there are a number of factors that drive that office in the first um you know in the first few years and i'm still the to start to scale um that's gonna be significantly diluted um to the number that i mentioned earlier which is the three twenty five to three seventy five in the first full year post launch so um i think uh you know i i would also know that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's you know that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's you know we're the arrangement we have you know have pretty acquisition with grail obviously that they buy evidences and consumers from us but we also get a royalty on on the grail revenue and you know as we thought through you know sort of we modeled what that look like over the next fifteen years you know it's it's clear to us that you know we participate uh more fully so we get more revenue more margin dollars uh in you know if we acquired grail so just financially this is a much better way of captured the value in the market uh then continuing to be a supplier to grail with the royalty and and as sand pointed out this is a sixty billion dollar market opportunity you know we we are able to sort of capture the value better in the current agreement in terms of uh the royalty back to grail uh shareholders and just as a point there as you heard in the prepared demands we are twelve percent currently of the of uh grill shareholding so you know the royalty you know you gotta adjust it to the twelve percent that uh that we own ourselves and the the thinking here was look we as we were working with the grail investors you know this is one area where you know clearly they see the opportunity in front of them and there was a gap in public they saw it and we were a little bit more conservative and so this was a nice way to sort of bridge that to say look we're gonna make sure that we participate if the opportunity is much bigger than we think then everybody wins otherwise we all share if it's if it's a little bit less than we thought and so this was a way to structured over the next twelve years where we could you know align our and you know demonstrating it's the market ends up being much bigger than every time steve utah with well research your line is open uh hi good morning uh thanks for time uh i'll ask just to uh one i actually wanna follow up on a point that that type of raise uh and it's about you know how you wanna articulate uh right now what you think about the the core business i i appreciate the points that you know all of us i a bank nhs all coming on and i'm uh next year uh i'm a way to see the pipeline but i wonder would you be comfortable you know taking a view that the the core business the ex-girl business is a double digit grower uh as far as you can see out into the future and then my second one is as you think about the landscape of providers you know out five or ten years ago from now at a five or ten years from now what does it look like in terms of how many different cancer detection assays you you think are out there having illumina involved in in this particular uh way it means that there's gonna be one you know obviously very large scale player the ways to uh to come at this particular market can you talk about how you see that looking and what is the importance of the the rather substantial ip portfolio uh that uh you had flagged uh francis and hans as you think about what that landscape looks like thank you very much thank you steve so a couple of question one is you know how do we think about the core business and the second one is how do we think the landscape for cancer detection assays will play out will there be a significant single winner will there be multiple players so let me go to the first one you know the uh i absolutely am comfortable you know saying that we expect our core business over a multi-year period you know to generate double digit growth you know we are still as we said in the very early stages of understanding from a research perspective even how genomics translates into you know health and disease but from a clinical perspective we're also in the very early stages of penetrating some of the markets we talked about like oncology therapy selection and genetic disease testing genetic disease testing with less than one percent penetrated so i am comfortable that over a a multi-year period you should be seeing double digit growth from the core business um and that you know the acquisition of grow is intended to accelerate that even further but even without it it's a double digit grower in terms of how we expect the cancer detection market to play out you know this is a very very large market and you know we talked about a sixty billion dollar market and so we expect that there will be multiple approaches for this market that you know some will focus on on single cancers or small set of cancers some will be pan cancer um and and frankly that's how we've modeled you know sort of uh the revenues for us that we expect there to be multiple players you know trying multiple different approaches serving different study of the market um and and again with the market this big and and this important we we expect it to play out that way and this is all the time we have for questions the other a team thank you all for your participation in today's conference this concludes today's call you may now disconnect
