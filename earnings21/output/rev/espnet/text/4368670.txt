welcome to the r w e conference call <unk> cfo of r w e a g will inform you about the developments in the first half of fiscal twenty twenty i will now hand over to thomas danny thank you <unk> good afternoon ladies and gentlemen and thank you for joining us today to discuss our new east result for the first six months of the year i'm joined by our cfo marcus cover who will run through the presentation before we move on to q and a later in the call as in q1 this year in order to compare like for like our presentation focuses on the proformer figures in comparison to twenty nineteen meaning that assets taken over from ian in the third quarter last year i included for adjusted ebitda and ebit for the full year two thousand nineteen and with this let me hand over to marcus for the update on h one twenty twenty yeah thank you thomas and the warm weather come to everyone on the phone it's good to speak to you and i really hope you are safe and sound wherever you are dialing in from today the operational and financial performance in the first half of twenty twenty has been good overall and so far we have only seen a small impact on the business from the covid nineteen pandemic on a performer basis year on year adjusted e b d a of our core business increased nine percent to one point five billion euros the rw groups adjusted e b d a stands at one point eight billion euros we confirm our four year guidance and now expect just an e b d a to be at the upper end of the guidance we also confirm our target to increase a digital payment to eighty five cents per share for this year oh and that now is sense at seven point eight billion euros this is a decreased by roughly nine hundred million euros compared to q1 our clear target is to meet a leverage factor of around three times adjusted core e b d a to net debt at e end and we are delighted that the assets office eon is finally fully closed the legal integration and the hr integration have already been completed the teams are now operating in the target management structure across the entire business let me remind you that the energy activities which we transferred back to r w e have been recorded in our group figures already as they were commercially assigned to us we do have see any relevant effect from the final closing in our financials what else we are excited about our latest announcement on the deal to acquire nodex two point seven gigawatt development pipeline in unsure and solar this gives us great option for future growth and the broad entry into the french market i will come to back i will come back to that in a minute regarding our code and nuclear business we are pleased that a cool phase out act which found broad consensus was brought into germ law link that phase out is supplemented by a public law contract drawn up by the federal government and the operators which will pass the germ parliament after the summer break the law and contract are subject to approval under state law we expect this process to happen in autumn this year this is we now have a clear path on how to exit from our remaining cold operations <unk> edit and transferment let me briefly come back to the transaction with <unk> on page four this transaction is a strategic pipeline enhancement in our end our broad market entry into france straight instance our existing pipeline of twenty two gigawatt and the projects to be built will come on top of the targets announced at the capital market date we expect qds as early as next year and additional capacity of approximately five funded megawatt in operations by twenty twenty five we are also pleased that this creates a great opportunity to enter the french market one point nine megawatt of the development projects are in france of which roughly three hundred megawatt are close to f i d or in late development stage france is a very attractive functional market with huge build out targets and the solid renumeration framework france was the only large market in europe where we where we were missing a pipeline and a strong development team together with a pipeline and experience team of seventy professional mostly based in france will join us to drive our growth ambitions in france further in markets have we already operate assets the pipeline gives additional options spain approximately four hundred megawatt screen approximately four hundred megawatt and pull in a small position of more than ten megawatt what are the next steps we have agreed in exclusive put option with nox on a purchase price of four hundred two point five million euros nox kicks off the consultation process with the french works council which needs to be finalized before the put option can be exercised the completion of of the transaction is also subject to foreign investment clearance in france and the completion of common capital processes it is assumed that the transaction could be completed in the first quarter of this year now back of the financials for h one twenty twenty on page five in our core business adjusted e b t a increased by nine percent to one point five billion euros as a result of a good performance in all segments broadly speaking the good h one results for offshore wind and onshore wind solar was due to the very good better conditions in the first quarter and on short capacity additions the hydro biomass gas division mainly benefited from the resumption of the gb capacity market enter supply trading division outperformed after successful start into the year which continued which continued in the second quarter ladies and gentlemen our wind and solar business is progressing well in stock capacity remains unchanged at eight point nine year old but there's more to come in the second half of the year and we make good progress towards our growth targets for twenty twenty two amongst others we have taken the f i d for the hickory parks solar farm in the us with the capacity of one hundred ninety six megawatt and the co-located forty megawatt battery which is due to be commissioned in twenty one the project is under the investment tech credit its regime and has secure a thirty year ppa with georgia power regarding the period after twenty twenty two the able in more offshore wind farm has secured an agreement for lease with the crown estate the project is an extension of or operating twenty more wind farm additional corotic capacity is three hundred megawatt what are the next steps the development of the project will continue with review to participating in cfp auction rounds in three to five years this time furthermore we welcome the announcement from the irish government that the dublin array offshore project has been designated as one of seven relevant projects meaning it will be fast track to the new marine planning the project will add three hundred megawatt capacity and is currently in the development phase subject to an updated content application and investment decision construction could begin in twenty four with u d in twenty six and lastly we are now participating in the third floating demonstration project together with the university of maine as well as mitsubishi corporation we will develop a demonstration project of the coast of maine we continue to drive floating offshoring because we see great potential for floating wind farms worldwide in particular countries like the us with deeper coastal waters let's move onto an update of our construction program in is progressing well apart from some covid nineteen related delays mainly at us construction sites so that we had to ship the idea of approximately five hundred megawatt from twenty to twenty one due to the adjusted coming plan we expect the overall financial impact for this year to be a small to medium double digit million euro amount please note that the ptc income level of the us project is secured in any cases at all sides now we'll take a look at the status of the individual projects we've presented to u a q one starting with the offshore division our tried no project offshore construction work started earlier this year everything is progressing as planned at the casualty project contract with main suppliers assigned so preparatory preparation work is continuing and going according to plan the construction work will start and cues for eight twenty twenty one the clock and the forest onshore wind farm is already generating and receiving revenues from the contract for difference as soon as wind farm testing is completed and c o t is reached who reported as in stock and <unk> good availability at the cranal onshore site has been achieved and the commissioning of the individual winter one is ramping up the actual commissioning date is scheduled for this month we have update our milestones at our big raymond on shoring project one part of the project namely raymond west with twenty two hundred forty may what will slip into q1 twenty one where the commissioning of raymond east was two hundred that megawatt is expected in the second half of q4 twenty twenty c o d of scott rich has moved within the fourth quarter to the end of december this year on the basis of the adjusted timeline construction work is on right commissioning ramp up will start soon and at the alignment day solar found the good registration process took more time than expected due to the current circumstances c u d has therefore slipped into q1 twenty one in total we will bring one point freaking out online in the second half of the year mainly back end loaded with that we can move to the details of the individual segments the actual individual realized and adjust e b t a of five hundred eighty five million euros year on year this is an increase of nineteen percent thanks to higher wind speeds in the first quarter ross cash investments in h one march two three hundred sixteen million euros mainly driven by tried another construction work the sale of the sea breeze installation with vessel is the main driver for gross cash divestments we confirm the outlook for the offshore divisions our unsure when solar division increased twelve percent year on year and adjusted e b d a amounted to two hundred seventy three million euros at h one whether you drivers are an increased in capacity of approximately three hundred eighteen megawatts year on year s as higher earnings in europe from above average weather conditions in the first quarter this year most of the gross cash investments are for the u s enter projects agreement scott rich and casa <unk> as well as boiling springs despite the small to medium double digit million euro negative impact from tighter commissioning faces and the delay big raymond alignment deal we confirm the outlook for the full year the hydrobiome gas division delivered a good performance over the first six months higher earnings results mainly from the british capacity markets in contrast to the strong first water at h one earning from the commercial optimization of our power plant dispatch have normalized in june we signed a contract to sell our georgia biomed business to enviva partners for a purchase price of one hundred seventy five million us dollars the transaction was closed at the end of july after successful merger clearance the disposal is already reflected in the guidance we gave you in march the ebitda contribution for performer twenty nine nineteen was a good thirty million euros in twenty twenty it is approximately half this amount as we have already reported to the market the fire the emsf and power plant has caused an interruption to biomed co-firing which we expect to last until november twenty twenty this will impact the outlook by a small to medium double digit million year old model despite this we also confirm the guidance for this division moving on to another quarter of favorable earnings development from the supply and trading division and h one adjusted e b d a amount to three hundred twenty two million euros on the back of a strong trading performance and good results from the getting energy business we didn't expect the division to replicate the exceptional performance of the first six months of last year the division outlook is one hundred fifty to three hundred fifty million euros given the strong <unk> we expect to end at the upper end or even above ladies and gentleman having now report on the core business let's move to the code and nuclear division and just that e b d a has ablet here on year and amount to three hundred ten million euros as we already mentioned at q1 earnings improved due to higher realized wholesale prices and an updated production plan in the lakenet system nevertheless we need to consider implications from the implementation of accelerated exit plan for the full year we confirm the divisions outlook moving onto the earnings drivers down to adjusted net income adjusted net income amount to seven hundred ninety five million euros due to the high adjusted e b d a or w e group the negative effects in the financial result of minus a hundred fifty million euros from q1 were are be compensated by the e and evident of one hundred eighty two million euros we received in the second quarter adjustment in texts are applied with a general text rate of fifteen percent in line with expected mid to on tax level for the group the tax rate of fifteen percent has been derived from all income streams it is based on blended local tax rates the use of loss carried forward and the low taxation of dividends including the eon and beyond divid and now onto the adjusted operating cash flow the adjusted operating cash flow shows the impact on the debt from operating activities it is adjusted for special items and timing effects that balance out over time the utilization of nuclear provisions is not included as you will remember we consider this as a financial cash flow as when the nuclear provisions are utilized they can be refinanced by a answer that in h one the adjusted operating cash flow top two billion euros and is build up on the high adjusted e b d a as well as a positive effect in working capital change in work in operating working capital of four hundred thirty seven million euros is mainly driven by the payment from the british capacity market from twenty eighteen and nineteen which we received in q1 as well as a reduction of guest inventories for the full year twenty twenty we expect this line item to remain positive for the same reasons turning to the details on the development of net debt at the end of june net debt increased to roughly seven point eight billion euros first and foremost this was due to timing effects from hatching activities of roughly one billion euros mainly related to co2 another driver of net debt is the company's net cash investments clearly linked to our strategy to expand and renewable energy the dividend payment for fiscal year twenty nineteen is already reflected in the net that figure at h one we see a leverage factor of around three times net add to core adjusted e b d a at year end which considers the investment of approximately four hundred million euros for the acquisition of the two point seventy developed nordics development pipeline volatility and commodity prices and interest rate could temporarily drive it slightly above three times but if this is the case we are confident that we will return to our target level in the medium term without an impact on our plant capex program finally moving onto the outlook for fiscal twenty twenty as i already said we confirm our outlook for this year adjusted ebta of the core business will come out between two point one five and two point four five billion euros adjusted e b t a for the group will range between two point seven to three billion euros and adjusted ebit between one point two to one point five for both adjusted e b t a and adjusted ebit we expect to series our is at the upper end of the guidance our guidance for adjusted that income is eight hundred fifty million to one point one five billion euros and we expected to be in the middle of the range due to the negative one of in the financial results which we experience in q1 dividend targets unchanged eighty five zero cents per share for fiscal year twenty twenty and with this i conclude my remarks and i'm now happy to take all your questions thank you and as always in view of time you know please stick to two questions only operator please start the q and a session ladies and gentleman if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad if you change your mind and wish to withdraw your question please press start to you will be advised when to ask your question our first question is coming from the line of <unk> from credits please go good afternoon <unk> <unk> two questions for me the first one is on the negative power price in the uk there is a close in the most of the cfd to say that if the power price goes negative for emergency hours then basically cfcs to apply for for that time that is that's what we apply for all your assets in the uk and is and that's the same as similar to existing other markets then other we operate in and the second question is uh on the renewable target growth when can we expect other we to rise the annual renewable target growth i mean we've seen recently energy increasing the annual target from three to four gig thank you very much yeah thanks for your question i mean um yes the negative price will applies to uh the uk um and we have a similar one but the technical details are slightly different also in germany i mean i have to admit i don't know the exact details and so far um i think um i mean you can you can usually plan it because you know your power price forecast on a quarterly our basis for the full year and uh i mean it has not had a significant negative effect which was not planned for us even this year so for us it's a it's a minor technical technicality um and if you want the details i think please call the team more so to understand where the drum measure deviate from the uk one um on the targets i mean we already gave you an indication with the nodex pipeline that uh comes on top of our targets but i mean our targets have been communicate is it a couple of months ago so don't expect us that we give you new targets every month so when we deem it appropriate that we need to update the the market about new plans or revised plans we will do it but we will not do it on a quarterly basis thank you i mean i would appreciate if you could i guess back to me on the on the details on the technical details on the negative power price i know that it's not the issue for this year next year but we see more and more of a negative power price on the market yes we will come back thank you very much but i mean just remark i mean uh the the moment it becomes viable you usually i mean um but the team comes back but i think i mean for i think it's an overrated issue also going forward because what we see is um we get more and more flexibility in the system in many markets so the periods of very negative power prices should naturally come to an end i mean not for the specific plan you cannot do anything for the cfd plan but the model overall because incentivizes investments in flexibilities like batteries um and that these if you get more of that it will definitely take at first the negative power prices away so we don't see it as a big issue going forward but the team will come back on the technical technicalities thanks alex thank you wonder next question please the next question is coming from the line of benson irl from jp morgan please go ahead yeah it's good morning good afternoon uh quick one um could you provide us a bit more uh color on the nordic pipeline but at an asset level so we had this and we see the geographies so mainly into the uh uh uh of a print in uh in the french uh on shore uh market um so we understand the strategy behind it it would be great if we could get a bit more color on the on the project level uh while a big projects which are in there um and uh basically what is the expected time for contribution there uh so it will be the question one and bouncing back on this um what is your view regarding acquisition in a renewable assets uh given current prices buying a pipeline is one thing buying an existing uh operating asset is another one uh do you see that like value creative and uh would you um in such a situation consider uh potentially even found in uh large acquisitions uh um by uh reconsidering your stake in here thank you very much yeah um thanks for your question let me start with the letter one i think for us i mean having a um a deep pipeline where we can and invest our money it would not be um let's put it value optimal to actually acquire existing assets because we want to we want to build them we want to operate them um and as becoming a financial in i mean i see it difficult that that is really value creative it's a different thing if if you can maybe swap assets here and there to um to to change the portfolio mix and get some synergies here and there but i i don't see it as very relevant for the near future so i mean we are interested in strengthening our pipeline especially as we have done with the knowledge i come to in a minute but um acquiring existing assets um asset by asset is not part of our um investment uh investment plan i mean on the nordic pipeline i mean let me let me start first with why this was strategically important as i said in my speech because france is a very attractive onshore market we i mean the double side of cfd for twenty years inflation link um we have seen prices in the last options between sixty two and sixty seven euros so you can see that that is very attractive um and it was on the european landscape the one target market where we really missed a presence so it was really a good opportunity for us we looked into the pipeline in in detail as you can imagine in the due diligence and i mean we have very good locations good wind conditions clusters in geographic activity that that um will provide efficiencies and um i mean again i will not talk about specific locations now because um the transaction is not closed and we are bound to confidentiality so i can give you a view of how the portfolio will look like i will give you more color in a minute but i cannot talk about specific sites um i mean we can we can give you more color um after the closing of the transaction um what we have already said is fifteen percent of the pipeline is um is close to f i d or very late development stage and we expect the first you'll use by twenty one on average we would at least expect a hundred megawatt from the pipeline per animal so that we have by twenty five another five five that may go with other operations um including the the purchase price of four hundred two point five million we expected the irs of the projects will be within our given range uh at the capital market day we set for material sure pv markets we expect five point four point five to eight percent but please i mean this is a very um um material market and we had to buy it so don't expect it at the upper end of the four and a half to eight percent but um clear in the in the range we saw the price as attractive i mean it's always very difficult to judge or assess the price from the outside in but we have also seen other pipelines we participated in many due diligence in france um so we know also other pipelines look like and just looking at it from the outside in you have seen acquisitions in in that market which were priced at a hundred fifty to two hundred fifty euros per megawatt and we are at the lower end of that but i mean that is very difficult to call pairing crisis um on that level pipeline by pipeline the split um of the of the maturity of the pipeline is more or less in line with the maturity of our overall um of our overall pipeline i mean a on as i set fifteen percent is close to f i d and late stage we have around thirty percent mid stage and the remaining part is in early stage development thank you very much thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of peter <unk> from both of securities please go ahead hi yeah um thanks for taking my questions so just uh uh another one on the no deck uh portfolio could you sort of tell us how the four hundred million acquisition price and the uh i guess additional capex that you're gonna be spending over the next couple of years fits into your existing five billion capex budget does it display something else out about budget or is it in addition and i guess if it's in addition then wherever you found that extra balance sheet capacity please uh and then my second question as she was just on carbon um which has obviously been that uh very volatile uh over the last couple of quarters i guess your supply trading division might have profited from that but um i was just wondering could you give us your views as to what's actually being driving the carbon price particular um you know is it sort of a mid to high high twenties thank you yeah peter thanks for the question um on the nordic pipeline yes it will come on top of the five billion um as we have said with the announced of the transaction and now um the question regarding um um funding i mean as we as i said in the speech um we expect um to be within the leverage target um of the three times in that debt to e b t a um including the four hundred million and i mean we have a lot of moving parts i mean if we assume and i also hinted to that that commodity prices especially gets and co2 and interest rates stay where they were at end of june then we have a good view what other moving cash items operating cash flow investments we know our divestments are into to georgia biomed we're gonna pay back the hybrids i mean that is all very stable and we can foresee that we end the year at around three point zero but of course we cannot control commodity price and we cannot control interest rates but these are only i mean timing effects i mean it will normalize over time that's why we are confident if we move up then it will come down without impacting the capex then later uh the project investments after the i mean when we when we do cod that will be part of the of the um capital allocation approach but of course as i hindered to um will come on top of our existing targets but i mean a hundred mega would here and there that will not move the needle on the company of our size it's called i'm sorry sorry exactly um yeah i mean even even within the team here we have two different views and i think that's a good reflection of how i see the market short term is more bearish because um i mean with the covid situation with a very low gas prices significant fuel switching muted industrial demand i mean the demand for carb certificates is definitely much lower than it has been it has and expected um on the other hand it's also clear that the more political mid to long-term view is more bullish because i mean somehow the the european commission needs to implement the more aggressive tutor reduction target and it doesn't matter whether they go to i don't know fifty fifty five or even sixty percent reduction by twenty thirty a significant part of that maybe even more than half needs to come from the u e t s and that would definitely the mean that prices will go up and maybe what is different this time than in the last financial crisis in the last financial crisis we have seen that a lot of industrials who are sitting on excess so certificates um were in financial trouble and they needed to sell um just to to get to get liquidity this is with a huge program of the central banks and the physical support now different maybe some industrials take or the political long-term view and use the liquidity they still have to buy uh cheaper and the expected prices to be i think these are the two camps uh short-term long-term um and since this market is nothing you can fundamentally and that's always a sentiment question and i think the more dominant factor is definitely the midterm to long-term political view yeah i can i can simply not imagine that if prices go down to fifteen euros again that the politicians will sit there do nothing okay interesting thanks very much for that thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of alberto <unk> from goldman sachs please go ahead thank you and good afternoon uh the first one is to go back to the e on a stake uh we heard in the past that maybe badly counted about half of that could be used against slick net liabilities and the rest could be used for growth could you please confirm that and when it comes to growth can you help us understand the logic would it be contingent to maybe a big offshore wing or perhaps to identify something external like you just did with with no that can be something bigger and secondly it's just thinking about the ma from a diff from perspective like are the bue as a potential target so we are seeing all companies very quickly moving into the space uh you know vp with a fifty gigawatt net target by by twenty thirty um company like yourself would be like plug and play you know developing with existing capacity so do you think there is a race to scale here and what would be the best way for you to think of uh a threat like this one uh um that or thanks for the thanks for the question i mean on the ian state i can just reconfirm that everything is still valid which we have said in the past um i mean the ian state is not tied to the link that provisions we just said we currently use it we could also back to the lena provisions by other financial portfolios um and i mean when you look at the the the potential sourcing of of financing yes i mean we potentially need half of it to back to lena vision and the other half would be available to capital rotation um but um i mean that has not changed it's exactly what we said before um usually we have two questions so you had three which one do you want me to answer now the that question or the other one i start with the old question and then let's see whether we still have time um perfect thank you um because i think that's the more interesting one i i do agree that it could that we couldn't at the situation that um it's the race for scarcity because i mean it might be difficult to if you put together or the or the capital investment plans of everybody around in this in this fear um it's almost impossible to employ that amount of money until let's say twenty thirty because they are simply not in a project and you have more lead times to do it so existing pipelines become much more um valuable i think the investors of big oil and others need to ask themselves the question whether it's really green green investment if you buy existing stuff from others um because there is not a positive contribution um it's just i mean um over bidding in prices so i mean on the question whether we could become a target or not i think your company is very positioned to have the old companies figuring that out and be sit and wait what happened um yeah got it well i mean that's actually i mean that's not in our control what so what can we do i mean i'm i'm actually happy that also others see the field of renewables and the overall power sector is attractive because that's our that's the core of our strategy and i think we have all the in the ingredients to be successful we have the vendor experience team we have a deep pipeline which actually needed to be developed over a decade um and of course we have an investment discipline and will ensure that we put the money where we get a decent return and we will continue doing that i mean developing our pipeline um investing in good projects and also being on the technological forefront be it battery speed h two or be it um floating offshore where i actually don't see limit thing factor is the long-term market growth because the long-term market growth of renewable and also power overall is i mean tremendous globally the trend to electrification and to green is very supporting and where also don't see a limiting factor is funds because if you have good projects i think investors are actually looking for investment opportunities and now you need to ask yourself who actually brings what to the table i mean the market grows there itself that's not the problem so what you need is experience in the pipeline thank you that's great thank you that next question please the next question is coming from the line of rob pulling from morgan stanley please go ahead hi um yes good afternoon everyone um so um first question marcus um is um can we talk about the eu recovery fund um and how do you think internally that rwe will benefit from this um and there's a a a second part to that not a second question can you help us understand practically how the money flows from a number on a presentation slide into actual projects cuz that still seems very unclear um the second question and hopefully a lot simpler um is you have secured to make your age in the uk um could you provide an update on the process you have leases for some of the other extensions you've flagged at the c m d uh namely great <unk> and <unk> um has that been successful is that underway or is that not this year's business thank you uh let me start with the easier one rob um i mean we are working on the lease extensions and um we it will be around eight hundred to one point two eight hundred megawatt to one point two gigawatt and um we are optimistic that we can uh finalize it and by then uh bucket as um as least secured by at the end of the year um but it's going um it's going well um and uh on the european recovery fund let me start with the second part of the question um yeah i mean i think we will we will we will learn about it over the next um let's say two quarters until the end of the year how the flow of the money will really go because usually the european union works in a way that it's just uh they don't have they have only little funds like the just transition fund and stuff like at where at double digit million where they put money directly into specific projects usually the european union's budget is a huge kind of i mean shifting mechanisms so people are paying a net in and getting money in that out so what now as the next step needs to happen is that the individual countries needs to come up with programs and plans where to invest the money and if that takes all boxes they will get their proportional share of the money so we need to wait for national uh actions where they're gonna put and where they want to invest and how they support certain things is also unclear i mean you can do it with direct subsidy you can do it with the renumeration framework is is simple simpler financing i mean it's it's still totally unclear um and um the only thing what we can do and it's the first part of your question i mean we are um we are also now actively looking especially in age in the in the evolving age two sector and of course what is obvious is if more renewable power is needed and you get an indirect renewation framework for renewable power by the support of demand for green hydrogen you we are definitely ready to build more renewables but we are also willing to invest into the production of hydrogen that depends on what agreement we find with the partners is it better our money or there and how do you structure the contract the question is who puts money into transportation maybe maybe more others we need to be seen whether that needs to be unbundled many open questions so i think the important step now is to get the right partners together and think it through what is feasible and you should do literally start with the demand i mean who actually needs the hydrogen and then uh you you do um you backward really renew it um and i mean i think these are the big fears um our current business already so especially renew and storage technology and the new one which will come in addition is hydrogen but also i want to kind of not spoil the party but i mean if we talk about profits from especially hydrogen probably we need to wait a couple of years we what is relevant um in terms of investments but also in terms of profitability um and maybe um the kickstart of the of the solar and wind business is a good proxy it could easily take at least half a decade made a decade before it becomes a relevant profit figure that's um super interesting thank you very much and good luck with the um with the lease um the lease rounds thank you we will update you whenever we have good news thanks well next question please the next question is coming from the line of sam ari from ubs please go ahead hi good afternoon everybody thanks for the presentation and i'm uh uh so results today i just wanted to ask um two questions one on returns and one on farm down so on on returns i think um you had spoken at the cmd about uh one hundred to three hundred bit spread above whack as being typical in the renewable business these days a hundred to three hundred bits doesn't actually sound that crazy as an estimate of the whack actually as well and i don't know the lower the whack the lower the spread that you need to make the same kind of value creation ratio so it just seems to me that a year or two ago was coming to talk about high single digit returns in renewables or mid to high single digit returns i'm talking about unleveled project returns but are we now more likely to be going into the low single digit returns territory and is that you know is that possibly a fair outlook for offshore wind as well where returns it's actually been a bit higher just loves that love to know what what your thoughts are about that at the kind of industry level and then my farmdown question is just look at i feel like we're gonna see over time more and more pressure from auctions and and tenders and developers may be eventually forced to bring the farm down partner with them to the tender so if you like the competitive pressure of auctions will mean that this kind of extra value arbitrage that you currently get in a farm down might might eventually get captured by the consumer or you know the public body that's doing the tender so i'm just wondering do you think that's a reasonable expectation and if you thought about whether in the future you will sort of as standard go to auctions or tenders with a with a finance partner alongside and have you talked to any specific funds or partners about that kind of long-term approach so returns and finance thank you uh sam thanks uh thanks for the discussion i mean on returns i agree that um we definitely see that the x are coming coming down i mean i also carefully with your your report and you also put now very low numbers to x um which i think is is the right thing um and um but i'm not there that i would say we see now low single digit returns for um for for offshore i that's not where we are i mean definitely if we have promised you uh the average ir and and level project of six hundred fifty basis points um for the for the investment program we have outlined until twenty twenty two uh potentially the absolute returns not the value creation but the absolute returns of the next capex program will be lower but also because the rec is significantly lower but when you talk about the absolute level i'm not at um low um media i mean low for me is free and and free something it will come down i mean what we see is not for the for the projects which we which we have after the twenty two horizon already visibility of the profitability i wouldn't call that low it's more medium farm down i'm not sure whether i got your credit i don't see i currently don't see that you have tenders where you need to bring your financing or where you have an advantage if you don't go into the option alone and getting an advantage when you already bring the financing part i haven't seen things like that what it's more and more obvious is that also now the new tender design to give you one example for taiwan that um local i mean local production becomes a dominant theme that if you want to put money in some place you need to prove that it's actually good for the regions where you get the lease it's good for the people you create jobs you use local suppliers that it's becoming more important important but what i don't see is that it's advantage that you already with the auction say that you're gonna farm out or bring a financing partner interesting okay well look that's helpful you know what i have a clarification no no no that's fine i don't wanna take up too much time but i'm sure we'll talk about this again and thank you thank you for to to bellful answers just then we will thank you thank you sam next question please the next question this is coming from the line of john <unk> from rbc please go ahead yes uh morning good afternoon everyone uh firstly on the the hedging of the outright book it looks as if you've accelerated the fully hedge portion particularly in twenty twenty two um obviously it's quite a small chart but from maybe roughly thirty to fifty percent which is probably more than you would normally do in a quarter so just wanted to understand some thinking behind that is there a particular view on power prices or spreads at these levels and then secondly on the three times leverage factor just to confirm that's not including the any potential asset rotation at the moment because there are some some headlines in recent days around some of your your offshore assets that you might be looking to to sell down um john thanks for the question i mean on helping you are right we increase uh the outside hatch so what we actually closed by that was a spread position um is there i mean what you could read into it is um if you think spreads are fair it's part of the risking now to close it um and um i think if you look at current market prices and spread i think everybody expects a hundred percent recovery by twenty two and if you wanna look that in your better closer position now um and that's what we have done that doesn't tell you what we i mean we don't know i of the global economy will look like but it's better to log it in now than to keep it open um on the leverage side um the three times uh net debt to e b d a includes our plans on capital rotate so it is it is it is our net investment target i mean we have outlined a net investment um of around one point five to two billion so if um we are gonna invest draw more uh given the the the profile and it also includes divestment i have already said that we divested um which is not yet in the financials uh georgia biomass for close to two hundred million dollars one seventy five and some adjustment um and um i mean on the other things we are considering our options um so um we will bring it to the net figure but i now don't wanna speculate on gross net because we always said that the leading metrics is searching gear what net so what whatever we do or disposals we will reach the thirteen year year okay net and also the ebit guidance for twenty twenty two is net guidance yeah so and how are we gonna achieve us with how much cross and how much disposals that we need to give the current uncertainties in some markets we need to have some flexibility and i mean if you now want to get a comment on the um on the on the rumors on on disposals i mean the comment is no comment because uh i mean uh we will update you when we have taken the decision not we will not update you whether we have on a certain assets or market test or not okay thank you thank you john next question please the next question is coming from the line of <unk> from bernstein please go ahead uh thank you uh so my two questions for certainly um in the us so if you do have a possible weekly for joe biden and uh they bring in uh the two trillion plan i was just wondering how does that change would you accelerate your group uh your uh the deconversion of your pipeline in the us or practically how might it change anything for you uh and my second question is uh is on the j is on germany it's health uh so obviously germany has pretty lofty targets at twenty thirty but we're seeing the options are continuing to go under subscribe on onshore wind do you see this situation changing with any kind of reforms and would you be uh taking the lead as as i don't know germany is national champion on this to to also grab maybe more more of the share in the german uh renew this market thank you yeah deeper thanks for the question the first one is easy we actually don't expect the uh uh uh sign it could impact from a potential federal election outcome in the us on on on our business i mean um i mean even even today i mean many things depend on on state level um of course the tech support is a federal thing uh but also the current administration um extended the ptcs uh given the covid situation so i mean that's pure speculation i would say it will not make a huge difference um and uh on german um of course we would like to do more onshore and um onshore in germany um and we see under subscribe options the problem is that the projects are not ready um to be to be bit into the auction um we have permitting issues we have um pending law cases and so on but there is some interesting um development because the minister of economic affairs he tabled a law a draft law yesterday what two days ago where they really wanna accelerate the permitting process and the court proceedings and um they also introduced something which is now heavily discussed also with the ngos that even if you um if you did future permission in court um that should still until the decision is there allow um the construction to go on um and that would be both very helpful so pedia processes and you can uh go straight to the to the five at a court level to get a decision and you don't need to go through the hierarchy and also um that nobody can by pure tactics in the courts uh delay projects um but let's see how the how the how the draft will go through parliament but the draft at least looks very favorable for the industry okay thank you thank you <unk> next question please the next question is coming from the line of peter <unk> from city please go ahead hi good afternoon it's <unk> from city i have two questions um the first one would be a small <unk> can you say what's the kind of current cost structure of it how is it significant numbers more number in annual europe figure as a cause as you take over the the whole company and secondly um i wanted to ask you on the c2 go back to this discussion because uh before the covid nineteen i thought there is an clear review which is that in mind by the switching between call and the gas of uh power plants now if we take call uh assets out what will be according to you uh your expectation the next secular review kind of cash hold how will the market will restore longer term uh equity view on the co2 prices we should be looking at this and then the elimination of co2 what's the next uh next thing to look for mm-hmm uh pedro thanks for the question i mean i'm not it's easy i mean we take over the company yet but it's a development company so what you actually have is the salaries and opex for the seventy people and of course the development expenditures for the two develop projects but i mean part of that is also capitalized yeah so it's a very i mean in terms of addition to the cost base it's almost not relevant um i mean the most relevant one will be uh the devx for the project and than the capex um okay on on co2 equilibrium um yeah actually the interesting thing is that the current co2 price is already above the fuel switching price from from heart code to s uh the current stack in most of the times looks um guess first then um then then <unk> and then um hard code so if you take out um hard code now that shouldn't change that you could the realm between um for the for the co2 relevant fuel switching price there shouldn't be a change the interesting elements as i said it's already trading about the count fuel switching level uh that can only be um explained that actually the industry expect uh shortage and um this is always difficult to judge because this market is not a um an annual market it's also since you can easily keep your certificates for longer um you can also say it's it's partly a view on what to come in future years um so i would not overrate uh the annual price which causes fuel switching that was in the old days of oversupply a good indicator but now the significant more tightness to come maybe that's not the relevant indicator anymore okay thank you thank you charter next question please the next question is coming from the line of <unk> from bloomberg intelligence please go ahead uh hi there two questions for me please uh the first one was on negative prices and i'm sorry if you covered it before i missed the very beginning basically austin reported yesterday it was no issue for them because of you know if the price is negative for the uh subsequent few hours your cfds and and whatnot you know your can't recruit yourself today so um is that have you seen it been an issue with you for the uh for the second quarter and um do you think the negative prices will be some more or less prevalent going forward the second question is on hydrogen um again um where do you think the value will lie it is in the production of hydrogen transportation of hydrogen converting it to other fuels like the curating et cetera where do you think the money will be and will you be a big player there thank you um if i could answer the last question um life would be easier it's i think it's too early to tell it also depends on how will the how will the incentivization framework look like and how big will the market become um and of course it has has a two a that you can incentivize green production and you can incentivize demand for green hydrogen um and um in the end it will be then kind of demand supply on on on the different angles where i actually don't see scarcity is um the production of green hydrogen in terms of electricalizers i mean that's a proven technology where we definitely have um scarcity already today is um renewable pro because um i mean if you believe um all the demand forecasts and i have no doubts that that is a good assessment we need so much green energy um that every project which is actually in the pipeline of somebody needs to be built one day it's just a question of time so this is really scarce scarcity um on the demand side i think that will be a competition by the off takers who is who can who can who can do it cheaper it's nothing for i mean if you if you ask me where i see our role it's definitely on the on the um production side green power potentially depending on how the consultation will look like also the product of queen hydrogen and then the structuring of the offtake i mean as we are currently also a very relevant player in guest trading and providing solutions to customers and that will also our role be in age tool and you can do that without reducing as we currently do with energy and natural gas the first person on negative prices i mean far as it i mean we have seen it in the uk and germany but um it's not uh it was not a relevant issue i mean it was not a big number okay thanks a lot appreciate it thank you next question please the next question is coming from the line of <unk> from jeffries please go ahead yes hi thank you um two question and so my side as well i'm just wondering if if we could get a little bit more color from you around these sort of how do you see this sort of the value creation opportunity relating to the nodex pipeline especially the sort of the near-term assets cause you you mentioned it's a it's a mature market some of the near term projects are fairly well developed close to fed sort of market where auto d had scale in the past i i was interested in understanding a little bit more how you see the sort the value proposition from promotively and i guess the second question is relating to that i think you mentioned earlier right this was one of the markets you didn't have presence and therefore you were you were sort of looking for opportunities looking at your exist in portfolio either from a pipeline perspective or a skill perspective are there any sort of specific gaps that you see that you think sort of sort of scaling up sort of benefits benefits quite beneficial thank you yeah i bet um thanks for the question i mean on um i would not say that we failed on france because we we were simply not present um it was always a strategic target to get a foot in the door and now we have not only a foot in the door but as a significant pipeline and the notx team was actually very successful in the french market i think they ranked number two in terms of success rates in two options in the last year and they have not only built this pipeline their business model was to build and then when they were close id and they've got them to the option they sold the projects to their potential customers um and i mean what what is the value creation potential for us i mean it's we continue what they have done in the past and we could was our strategic gap um and the team is not there just to deliver the pipeline which we have acquired they will continuously develop projects and the french market overall is very attractive um it's not so densely populated like germany so you have more spec um they have huge built out targets and even better renewation framework with a double sided twenty year inflation in cfd um so if you believe that um um unsure wind in france is good it will definitely create value and i mean we are firm believer that also the political environment in france and their targets to go straight from nuclear to renewables um will not be will not be questioned by some of the next government so it's it's a very intact uh gross platform um the games in our pipeline i mean i think it's always good to be honest i mean if you look into that um we are very wind heavy so doing more on the solar side with their really be good um let's see how we can achieve it i mean we have definitely we have definitely ramped up our um our development activities and you will see more to come especially in the attractive solar market like in the us um but still it's compared to the windside um underrepresented and the other one which is definitely significantly tougher maybe impossible to close if you look into our offshore pipeline they is in terms of cod dates and that's historically explainable because ian stopped and energy had also funding issues um but we have a gap between twenty two uh where we will commission try to know and then maybe the next project will be mission according to the current pipeline around twenty five maybe twenty six and that is i mean this is a profile how it looks like and if you ask me you have two wishes i would like to feel that time yet and i would like to have more on the solar side thank you very clear thank you thank you a man next question key the next question is coming from the line of <unk> from man glg please go ahead thanks well i'm hello um just uh i mean two quick questions one is in uh uh deep offshore uh wind flow thing i mean what's your view in terms of the the technologies that are around and you what do you envision that will be the the role of aws okay and thanks for the question because i mean i can use it as an opportunity to clarify what our interest is i mean we are not turbine manufacturing so um we are not betting on a certain technology um and um i have no view and also the team has no view what is the potential best floating technology for which uh market in which um seek conditions um so what we said is let's participate in different technologies be the beat concrete or beat still i mean you have also different i mean i'm not an expert on that but you probably you are you have totally different approaches to that and reset is we want to be part of constructions of several technologies to be an early learner we want to learn how this stuff works because um it is a bit different than uh fixed bottom it is uh in terms of windfield in terms of maintenance costs and so on and we want to learn that with different technologies that doesn't mean that we will in future if we go into offshore only use the technologies where we have been a partner early on we can also use others so and you asked for our role our role is we want to be um we want to construct and we want to operate also offshore wind farms but we don't want to build the turbines or the or the uh the foundation very clear and and just perhaps to tie up with alberta's question and the role of oil companies i mean you reason and actually that deeper shore uh you know be uh that to do know in in in enjoyment or in construction with with oil companies that they've experienced from offshore i mean that's that's speculation i mean but if you look at our um partnership um landscape mean we are operating one offshoring farm together with <unk> i mean they are partnered one of our farms one of the floating um technologies we are in we are together with shell in but i think i mean that can go one way or the other i mean it's too early i mean we are open to discussions um but we could also do it ourselves i mean and and the and related question when i compare our wv and you or strategy and you know what you want to be with the with the leaders in the in renewables so you know in europe the girl and then now certainly one of the company missing on the investment thesis is the full commitment to a girl in different i mean when do you think that you can have that full commitment and you know what kind of growth do you envision that you know you you you can sustain i mean i would not compare to anal i mean anal is a fully integrated utilities with um i mean most of the value sitting in the networks and they don't operate offshore i mean our business model is i mean is different um we had actually given a clear commitment to a growing dividend we said um we want to continuously grow with the grow the dividend broadly in line with the development of of um of the earnings of our operating core business um and since the core business given our investment plans will definitely grow also the dividend should grow um and we discussed it before so i said i'm in a good proxies maybe the five cents on top every year which we have to deliver for the last years i mean um can be maybe even more because of course the percentage goes to on if you stick to a to an absolute sent number but i think that's the comment would be active we want to grow the dividend in line with um earnings development in corporate in the core business but if the core business i mean for whatever reason you're not sustained i mean cannot grow i mean what's your commitment and you will get the dividend in line with the with the client of earnings on the core business i mean we should now i mean we should stick to the two questions rules so i still answer that one but then we should give the next one the opportunity to ask question otherwise we need to do it in a in a one-on-one session over the ir team please um i mean if you don't have enough growth opportunities i mean the first thing which is questionable then is why do you only pay out fifty percent of your project as dividend because you cannot employ it somewhere so that would that would totally change the dividend policy but it's not question of a cut then thank you next question please as a reminder if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad next question is coming from the line of robert <unk> rob pauline from morgan's family please go ahead yeah hi um rob pauline um i rejoined to ask another question if that's okay um but giving you've answered or not answered the question on the <unk> can i ask about us deferred tax liabilities a wonderful subject a us exposed utility reported yesterday a large tax charge as projects reached c o d and they entered into a tax equity partnership so will we see a similar tax impact at r d b e as it reaches c o d on your us projects thank you um so text answer the question to the text the answer to the text question is easy no we don't expect any huge number um but maybe the situation is difficult because you said a u s u to the t because we don't have tech penalty ourselves so since we don't have tech capacity our texas in the us are zero and um you need to actually bring in financing partners to read the tech benefits so the tech effect on our business is more than zero for a long time now sorry uh marcus i said uh us exposed uh company is actually a european name no we don't see an anything like that and you you you blame me you're not answering a hammer question what was your hammer question no hammer hammer of sure hammer and no we want to sell hammer here know that that's you don't get a lot of money for it for for some trees um no i didn't answer the humble question because i said i mean this is the room mind we don't comment on rumors what i just can reiterate is of course access portfolio management is part of the strategy but we will give you a an update when we have taken a decision and as long as we have not taken a decision to do something we don't talk about it fair enough thank you thank you i have a further question we have no further questions in the queue so i'll hand you back to your host for any concluding remarks perfect thank you all for dialing in stay safe and healthy and speak to you again later at our q3 with us have a good day bye bye thank you for joining today's call you may now disconnect
