reducing expenses adapting our operations to the current retail environment and aggressive the managing in countries has put the company in a much stronger financial position and provided the business with good momentum as we head into our busiest selling season looking at our total quarter more detail as we discussed on our q2 call in august we saw a significant sequential uptake and sell through in june for both our protection and power categories and several of our larger customers reopen their doors and resume more normalized store operations with some century weeks even exceeding last year's levels this trend continued into july and consistent improved throughout august in september while our online sales growth did temper a bit from levels we experienced early in the pandemic when much of the brick and mortar was closed it was still up nicely from a year ago and expanding this channel continues to be a priority for us we respect to overall performance q3 revenue came in at a hundred fifty million dollars compared to a hundred forty seven million and the year ago period a decrease of twenty one percent this represents a nice improvement from the twenty eight percent year of year decrease in revenue we reported in the second walker despite the roughly thirty two million drop in revenue compared to with the third quarter last year combined with some gross margin headwinds from higher freight expenses we delivered adjusted with our fifteen million dollars thanks to cost saving these measures we enacted early in the pandemic taylor will go through in greater detail on the balance sheet but i wanted to get share a few highlights despite significant market pressure from covid nineteen are account receivable dso has improved compared to last year and ventured client compared to where we end the q2 we generate a positive operating cash flow and we continue to reduce our quarter in net debt balance on a year of a year and sequential basis by taking quick decisive action back in april and more recently what closely with our retail partners under story-opening efforts we have been able to successfully navigate through incredibly challenging market conditions ensuring the financial viability of the company and position ourselves exit this difficult period as a stronger more nimble organization and now provide some additional color to our categories starting with protection we continue to build in our overall digital wellness strategy for a few years now our hero screen protector has been vision-guard a product to reduce exposure to high energy visit with blue life that can have done in effects without changing the screen colors or the peak resolution we have now sold over ten million years with this technology in addition all invisible machine screen protectors produce this year and beyond now also include anti-microbial technology this includes our entire lineup for a new iphone twelve which is now available in stores earlier this year we introduced our newest product here towards our digital when the strategy a uv uv phone sanitizer which works with our mobile devices and kids up to ninety nine point nine percent on staff nicole software bacteria our emphasis on protecting devices and their owners is resonating with retailers and our consumers and has led to increasing subsue and greater shelf space with many of our accounts we've expanded this strategy beyond screen protection x cases with good success starting with the samsung galaxy s twenty launch earlier this year and right through to the recent iphone twelve launch all gear for protective cases now lots of feature anti-microbial technology the combination of this hand and the benefit and gear four is differential dfo impact technology is driving excitement amongst consumers especially as awareness of the brand and products grow from our efforts to expand distribution with a new life on twelve gear four is now available and going across all of our carry our partners this expanded distribution accelerates the momentum here for a brand and i'm excited to see a continued growth through twenty twenty one in our paul category more we launched many exciting new products shown q3 including the introduction of a new line of what is charging solutions these innovations are focused on providing the ability to conveniently charge multiple devices in one central location in addition last month we launched a new more reduced pack connect this new product represents an evolution of our popular juice pack users to easily charge the phone on demand using a detachable battery feature that is not device specific and is used with or without the consumer's normal phone case our halo brand continues to perform well on qvc which has been a productive partnership and channel particularly give the number of consumers spending more time at home q4 is a busy time for our brands with qvc and hsn with a number of bearings plan during the holiday period looking ahead with the majority of our us partner doors now open and weekly sales will continue improve combined with solid direct to consumer trends we feel optimistic about our prospect extreme end of the year while there's still a good deal of uncertainty about how the virus will impact shopping behavior this holiday season including the effect on several countries in europe that have recently implemented lockdowns we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on demand regardless of which channel our consumer choose to engage with the brands we're currently planning for quarter revenue to increase from total quarter levels and continue improving on the year of the year declines we've experienced the as two partners even as we're facing tough comparison to last year's record two four sales i am confident in the long-term course of separate company our reference around anti-microbial uv sanitization and blue life protection are driven by our belief that consider we will increasingly look for solutions that will enhance the digital awareness we also believe another consumer priority will be increased productivity and comfort from home we will continue our focus on enhancing technology in our lives to accomplish these growing needs while it remains to to know when conditions will fully normalize and what impact covid nineteen will have in the global economy in our industry i am confident that we have taken the right steps to emerge from the pandemic as a stronger company this includes our decision to discontinue certain lower margin products and categories and simplify our core lines of business as a more nimble companies that can better service retail partners and core consumers capitalize on the tailwinds from the multi-year roll out of 5g with imagine benefits from our brand and carry from consolidation and generates increased by the of our shareholders i will now hand the call over to taylor thanks chris since many details of our quarterly financial performance were included in the supplemental financial information issued earlier today i would just like to take a few minutes to add some additional comments in our third quarter financial performance q3 net sales decreased year over year by approximately twenty one percent to a hundred fifteen million dollars after exiting a very difficult second quarter we saw good momentum throughout the third quarter as retail outlets continued to re open and allow a more normal in store shopping experience that being said the residual effects of covid nineteen combined with the delay of the launch of the new apple devices which pushed some which pushed some orders into q4 made it a difficult year over year compare overall we pleased with the momentum and sell through improvements we saw retail which enabled us to increase sales by almost fifty percent on a consecutive quarter basis from seventy seven million to a hundred and fifteen million q3 girls profit is a percentage of net sales decreased year over year to thirty three percent there were a number of puts and takes and impacted gross profit during the quarter including a benefit from net lower duty rates and expected duty refunds which i'll discuss in more detail in a second this benefit was offset by higher expedited air freight and increased air freight rates along with the sale of excess inventory margins that were lower than our historical averages on the subjects of duty refunds in early august we received an exclusion notice that duties paid on certain products importer from china starting in late twenty eighteen may be subject to refund we work closely with our customs broker to be in submitting refund documentation to us customs this work is ongoing and given the volume of imports from china since late twenty eighteen we'll continue throughout the fourth quarter based on the work completed to date we recorded a refund receivable a quarter end of approximately five point four million for duties paid that we expect to be refunded the income statement impacted this receivable offset by the balance sheet reduction from duties previously capitalized in inventory and then sold in q3 twenty twenty was a net income statement benefit of one point seven million or approximately a hundred forty basis points to gross profit margin during the quarter as i mentioned there's still quite a bit of work left to do during the fourth quarter to complete our remaining refund submissions and we'll provide an update on any additional refund upside on our next call q3 operating expenses decreased twenty nine percent or approximately twelve million compared to last year the decrease was due primarily to the various cost cutting by we implemented as a result of the expected covid nine covid nineteen impacts on demand over the last several months we've made the conscious decision to bring some individuals back from furlough to support fourth quarter product launches and customer care but we continue to be focused on all spend to ensure we navigate our way through this difficult time q3 adjusted that was fifteen million versus twenty one million in the prior year period that a client versus last year is linked to decrease sales and reduction in overall gross profit margin for the reasons i mentioned these items were offset by the decreases and operating expenses that i just discussed turning to the balance sheet compared to a year ago accounts receivable decrease thirty three percent to ninety one million due to the reduction in sales compared to the prior year period how i our dso has improved significantly from eighty seven days to seventy three days the quality of our receivables remains very good inventory was eighty million compared to ninety four million at the end of the first quarter a reduction of approximately fourteen million dollars during the third quarter we took conservative approach to inventory as we closely monitored retail sell through customer forecasts and customer inventory levels to ensure we didn't over extend on inventory purchasing as a result we did incur some incremental expedited air freight charges due to increase demand at the of the third quarter as retail sell through improved at this point we will continue to closely monitor the factors that influence our purchasing forecasts but will continue to plan conservatively due to the continued uncertainties related to the covid nineteen pandemic despite the continued headwinds with covid nineteen during the quarter we generated third quarter operating cash flow of approximately nine million dollars compared to negative eleven million in cash from operations during the prior year period net debt which is consolidated debt less cash decreased one million compared to ninety seven million in q3 last year in eighty five million at the end of the first quarter of twenty twenty as we discussed on the last call during april we amended our credit facility to increase the total amount available into the line of credit from a hundred twenty five five million to a hundred forty five million dollars this expansion combined with the loan received under the cares act the q2 restructuring and cost cutting initiatives we've undertaken gives us confidence that will successfully navigate the headwinds the covid nineteen is put on the business the capital allocation focused throughout the remainder of twenty twenty we remain on funding working capital needs and continuing to service our line of credit as we looked at the fourth quarter of twenty twenty we definitely have better visibility now than we did when we last spoke in august how we ever covid nineteen continues to create uncertainty around worldwide retail demand given this market uncertainty we will not be providing annual guidance at this time however given our current view of customer orders and positive retail sale through trends we expect strong sequential net sale as an adjusted ebitda growth over the third quarter we expect twenty twenty year today gross margins to improve during the fourth quarter though as i mentioned we'll see some pressure over the next next few quarters compared to historical averages of mid thirties as we sell through our excess inventory we expect total operating expenses to be in the same range of high twenties to low thirty million for the fourth quarter no different than from many other companies covid nineteen has been extremely disrupted to our business however with the steps we've taken to restructure the business reduce fixed costs and ensure adequate liquidity i'm confident to watch this period impacted by covid nineteen as a much stronger company than when we entered with that we will now open up the call for questions thank you ladies and gentleman is have a question at this time please press start in the number one key on your touchdown telephone again that is started in the number one key on your touchdown telephone your first question comes from the line of elliot alper from da davidson your line is open great thank you um so thanks for the um info on just the sequential sales in the fourth quarter i guess could you talk about any trends quarter to date specifically and specifically uh geographic sales mix are you seeing any material changes um with sales and geography that have lost restrictions compared to those that have more um yeah just uh just a couple of notes you know with the apple launch happening a little bit later than we um had experienced previously um there there was you know maybe five or dollars of of sales that shifted from q3 into q4 um which will obviously benefit kind of the the sequential um uh the sequential look at revenue um overall though we're seeing really good uh sell through of uh of the phones that seem to be viewed a very successful market and and uh obviously we're benefiting that benefiting from that so q4 starting off uh really really well um in terms of geos and you know no material change in uh geo expansion you know chris mentioned or geo mix you know chris mentioned on his in his prepared remarks that we we are definitely seeing some headwinds um at least in terms of shutdowns and some of our international locations however um you know the wireless dealers in those locations you know have been deemed as essential and so those have remained open and it's kind of remains to be seen as to how that's gonna impact um demand but um i think overall we're we're definitely seeing some strong signs that uh that we're kind of getting back to a more normal uh you know q4 experience though though obviously covid you know a bit of a a bit of a cloud over everything okay great and then um aside from the apple launch shifting into the fourth quarter um can you talk about the holiday season and kind of what may be different this year versus historically and of any implications that may have on the december quarter yeah the one thing that we will we are starting to see is obviously the black friday seems to be more some retailers are taking strategy but they're spreading us out over a number of days over the over the month so that's something that's going to be different i think we're still gonna see a pretty strong online um attachment from board side dot com and obviously through amazon but we we're very um i would say optimistic about the sales show there we sent you on our screen protection in cases are quite strong and that's given us we still have a number of other devices to take the market actually this week so overall i think we have some good runway for the holiday season yes okay great thank you thank you yeah and once again in order to ask a question please press star then the number one on your touchdown telephone your next question that's good that's good that's good that's great thank you i was hoping you could put a number on the expediting shipping costs that you uh that you incurred in the third quarter just to uh to give us some uh that idea how how's you know ken those were yeah it was you know between two and three million dollars and you know as i mentioned um in my prepared remarks you know we we really it was a bit of a balancing act with inventory where we're trying to run it down and you know sell through pay up at the end um you know we did have to move quickly and unfortunately resulted in some some expedited air freight charges and for the fourth quarter are you expecting that to uh to re occur or is it uh have you caught up and you feel like you're in a better yeah it's a it's a great question um you know i think we're still probably chasing a little bit of demand um you know the one thing that's also kind of impacted us uh no different than every other company that's importing from overseas is is just generally freight rates have increased kind of globally and so that's that's also impacted it but i think there's probably gonna be a little bit of that you know as i mentioned it's a bit of a balancing act we definitely wanted to uh be careful um you know given the pandemic and and how inventory we were planning and you know fortunately unfortunately we've seen some some upsides which is great but we've had to chase those and so i think we're probably still chasing a little bit which will impact some of our q4 um q4 sales and and then also obviously the spend on right great i also wanted to ask if i could really quickly about the tariff situation and now with a biden presidency i know you've been moving some production out of china does that change your your view on moving production out of china or how are you thinking about this uh this new regime yeah i i think uh man it doesn't change our strategy uh ultimately we're looking to diversify across our cm based and the make sure that we're setting the company up for uh continued business so we we're still following the strategy you know we've had a very good court or where we've now successfully have piloted both screen protection and wireless power outside of china so it gives us that ability to be able to shift our supply chain when needed obviously china is still a big part of our strategy but what i like is we're not just looking at it from a entire perspective now we're really looking at it from a business continuity perspective great thank you both thanks matt thanks matt thank you once again in order to ask a question please press charge in the number one on attached on telephone gentlemen i'm showing you for
