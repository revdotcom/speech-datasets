initiative is which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings and excess of forty million dollars from budget second quarter levels looking ahead the third quarter while the pandemic continues to impact commercial advertising we're seeing the same pattern of month over month improvement in our pacing day and expect to benefit from significantly increased levels of political ad

statement under income or loss on equity investments net and in the cash flow state and under distributions from equity investments the comparable three and six month period ended june thirty twenty nineteen reflects legacy next our operations during that period all actual results also reflect the impact of one time transaction expense is incurred in the quarters both in the quarters and the six month period ending june thirty twenty twenty and june thirty twenty nineteen with that i'll with a review of next starts q2 income statement and balance sheet data after which i'll provide an state on our capital structure and some points of guidance on a combined company basis and proformer for the divested station second quarter same station net total revenue was down six percent due to a decline in same station core advertising revenue of approximately thirty five percent reflecting a sharp decline in april due to the pandemic and subsequent month over month improvement from april to may from may to june same station distribution the revenue was up twenty eight percent and continuing digital revenues were down eighteen point two percent reflecting local agency services revenue growth of approximately eight percent while station website revenue was down approximately thirty percent due to software low local customer buying trends related to the pandemic to offset the anticipated impact of covid nineteen on commercial advertising revenue late in the first quarter next door limited a range of cost cutting initiatives which resulted in operating and corporate expense savings in excess of forty million dollars from budgeted levels in the second quarter of twenty twenty second quarter station direct operating expenses net of trades expense were approximately forty fourteen million up from two hundred ninety two million in the prior year primarily reflecting the full quarter of incremental expenses associated with the tribune operations and the budgeted growth in network affiliation expense as a partial offset to our rising distribution revenue second quarter of station s c a was approximately a hundred and fifty eight million inclusive of the tribute operations same station proform of fixed expenses excluding programming expenses we're down eighteen percent over year over year period due to synergies related from the tribune acquisition and the previously mentioned expense reduction activities in response to the pandemic corporate expenses were thirty five million inclusive of thirteen million of stock based comp and approximately five point four million of one time transaction expenses when excluding non-cash top and one time transaction expenses recurring corporate expenses for approximately seven two million which came in better than the guidance we had provided in the first quarter call of approximately twenty one point five million by the end of april the vast majority of the initial operating synergies of the trans transaction have been realized second quarter operating cash taxes were approximately six million substantially lower than our guidance of forty five to fifty million due to a timing difference that forty to forty to forty five million variance will now be paid in two three ongoing capex and transaction capex total forty million dollars spectrum repack capex total thirteen million and received approximately twenty six million of reimbursements from the fcc during the core as a reminder we anticipate being fully reimbursed for all sector related capex over the course of the year second quarter total interest expense amounted to eighty two million up from fifty one million in the same period in twenty nineteen while cash interest expense was seventy eight million compared to forty nine million last year with increases due to obviously the increased debt associated with the preview and funding partially offset by lower interest rates second quarter broadcast cash flow of hundred ninety one million as well as adjusted ebita two hundred ninety eight million and free cash flow of two hundred million all pre-transaction expenses exceeded consensus expectations and primarily reflect the realization of synergies and growth related to the third june transaction distribution free distribution agreement renewals executed in the second half of the year and the deferred tax cash taxes as i mentioned before adjusted ebitda on free cash flow rep uh reflect approximately twenty seven million in distributions from equity investments related to our thirty one percent ownership in the tv food network as a reminder we received cast distributions from tv food on a quarterly basis with the largest payment recorded to in the first quarter of each year for the third quarter of twenty twenty we anticipate recording approximately twelve million in tv food network distributions we expect cost savings in q3 to approximately twenty five million well to the originally budgeted levels as variable cost and discretionary expenditures are prudently brought brought back online with the expected strengthening of the economy and the broadcasting advertising environment for the third quarter we project recurring cash corporate overhead exclusive of stock comp and transactions cost to be approximately twenty three million and we will easily meet our run rate cash corporate overhead guidance approximately a hundred twenty million for the entire year non-cash compass projected to be approximately thirteen million dollars for the quarter and forty eight million for the full year transaction expenses will approximately three million for the quarter and will decline for the remainder part of the year third quarter operating cash taxes are now estimated to be approximately a hundred fifty million dollars and operating cash taxes for the entire year will now come in approximately two hundred fifty million in total non-operating in cash taxes associated with the gains on the asset sales and legal settlements in two three will be approximately eighty three million third quarter capex should determine that approximately forty million and we're still expecting approximately a hundred sixty million dollars for the into our year we're proceeding on budget with our investment related to the launch of wg in america's primetime national newscast news nation on september first and prioritized capital expenditures to main to maintain maximum flexibility in the current environment meaning the timing of certain capex can be delayed until uh later quarters if required finally we expect next star's cash interest expense to approximately seventy eight million for the third quarter and three hundred twenty five to three hundred fifty million for the full year reflecting interest expense savings related to the decline in library rates turning to the balance sheet next stars outstanding debt at june thirty was approximately eight billion dollars and consisted of five point four billion of term loans and two series of senior subordinated notes one at approximately nine hundred billion dollars and the other at one point eight billion dollars um with maturities of twenty twenty four and twenty twenty seven respectively total net data approximated seven point four billion at june thirty compared to seven point six billion at march thirty first and eight point three billion at twelve thirty one twenty nineteen net debt for first lean covenant purposes is five point two billion with net that net cash limited to a two hundred million dollar amount our first lane covenant ratio at june thirtieth was approximately three point one one compared to three point five two at year end which is well below our first lane covenant of four and a core as a reminder our first lane covenant limits cash editing to approximately two hundred million our total net leverage at quarter end was four point four seven compared to five point one eight at year end and as a reminder next door's only covenant is our first lean debt covenant which is the formation form a quarter at the onset of the pandemic next star took immediate actions to adopt our business to the current environment it's preserved liquidity in order to best position the company for longterm success as we return to normalized operations in this regard we continue to prioritize cash retention and after add approximately two hundred thirty one million to our first quarter cash position for a total cash balance of six hundred sixty five million at june thirtieth we an additional a hundred forty million dollars available under our evolving credit facility at the same time during the second quarter we returned approximately twenty five million dollars to shareholders through the quarterly cash dividend and made thirteen million in payments on our depth during the first half of twenty twenty we have accurately managed our capital structure cost of capital and liquidity position to support our business in this challenging environment while while enhancing shareholder returns year to date we have allocated by say five hundred ninety four million towards shareholder value creating initiatives including four hundred and seventy three million dollars in debt reduction fifty one million dollars in dividend payments and seventy three million dollars in share we purchase in the near to i'm a preliminary data suggest ongoing sequential improvement in economic trends and the commercial advertising environment we continue to focus on cash preservation in order to optimize our financial flexibility as removed through the third quarter looking ahead with continued double digit year over year growth in distribution revenue and what are expected to be robust spending levels related to the upcoming presidential election which we do not expect to be materially impacted by the coronavirus we have excellent visibility on over fifty percent of our annual revenue in twenty twenty as such we expect to be free crash flow positive in the third and fourth quarters in addition to continuing our dividend payments we remain committed to allocating the vast majority of our free cash flow towards leverage deduction and confident in reaching our target level for the reduced level of um comment leverage to four times by year end twenty twenty next star has already made significant progress on our leverage reduction plan and we enjoy a strong cash position with additional capacity as are a revolver in addition the reduction of an interest rate expense uh related to the favorable library rates operating expense savings in our capital allocation prioritization will also service well in the second half of twenty twenty as a result we're confident in our liquidity position and ability to service our death through these challenging times and do not anticipate liquidity or covenant issues as we move through the year in summary despite the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic our scale leadership flexibility synergy realization and operation plans are generating results our capital structure is in great shape from a cost of capital maturity and ability to quickly address leverage in addition our service to our local communities and local when national advertisers has never been stronger our disciplines in these areas have driven significant growth as well as consistency and visibility to our results and we remain confident in our ability to enhance shareholder value in the near term and on the other side a pandemic that concludes the financial review for the call i'll now turn it over back to perry for some closing remarks before q and a thanks very much tom in summary i hope that our comments today reinforce the fact that we remain confident and the strength and the resilience that next star is scaled and diversified business model next star's leading local platform is well positioned to withstand this environment through the several factors including our differentiated broadcast and digital sales programs a continued growth of our distribution revenue stream and what are projected to be record levels of political spending here in twenty twenty in terms of capital allocation we believe that our free cash flow combined with the active management of both our cost structure and our balance sheet will provide us with financial flexibility to continue supporting our shareholder value creation initiatives as a result next our as well positioned to fully participate in the recovery and we remain highly confident in our core strategies in terms of serving the communities where we have operations in building the top line maintaining close control of fixed and variable costs and optimizing the balance sheet this focus combined with our time proven operating strategies is enabling next year to overcome the near term challenges and extend our long-term record of growth and shareholder value creation we look forward very much to catching up with you with another positive report just after election day and on behalf of the entire next our nation our board and our management team thank you for your continued interest support and for your today so now let's open the call to q and a to address your specific areas of interest operator yes sir thank you and if you would like to ask a question please send my pressing star one on your telephone key pad if you are using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to a liar with military equipment again that is star one if you would like to ask a question and we'll take our first question from john genesis with wolf research thank you maria two for you one is you talked about local news and your shift what are you seeing in terms of advertise you're demanding growth in news relative to the day parts given the ratings you spoke to and then i guess the level in line with expectations is the really true that there's been no noticeable impact from the pandemic or is actually student to call given the life well as it relates to local news you know through the first six months of this year fifty one percent of our total advertising revenue came from local news and that's up over the prior years um uh cumulative totals which indicates obviously advertisers you know are putting their money uh into that product and increasing uh with increasing frequency um obviously the uh the demand is where the audience is and that's where the audience is for us right now um and so uh we do see continued read through and and we're hopeful that the audience gains is at least some of them will be sticky when you know when i hate to use this term when when the new normal settles in as to whatever that is but so far through this normal uh people in all age groups are uh tuning to our open news broadcast in in increasing numbers uh um i will say that i mean obviously uh mvpds have reported subounts and attrition for the quarter you know those are are factored into um into our projections and analysis and uh and our retrans revenue is again and we we forecast attrition into our budgeting process and and we are we are at budget on retrans revenue and our projections through uh through the end of this year so we have seen no significant decline beyond what we had forecasted so we think it's it's business as usual from a distribution revenue standpoint thank you very much our next question will come from steven call with wells fargo thanks um wondering if you could talk a little bit about uh your reverse compensation agreements as um subject lines are accelerating i was wondering if that's changing the tone of those at all and also does it make you think about moving from like a person basis uh sorry to a person basis from a fixed programming fee where you can and and relatedly we have more broadcast content going direct consumer like cbs all access in peacock so how do you think about monetizing those households that may not subscribing through the traditional process sure um you know i would say you know the the current relationships with the networks are a mix of you know fixed fee and um and uh percentages of of distribution revenue so there are some that that are fundable and others that that are not and those conversations are continuing what's in the best interest of both parties to get a deal done so there is some some hedge there at this point and we're you know we're not ready to call the ball as to what the the most preferable uh preferable term is uh they're based on our negotiating ability um as it relates to uh cbs all access uh we participate in that we're paid to be a part of that service and our local stream is a part of that offering uh peacock we are not uh affiliate uh local news affiliate streams are not yet a part of that broadcast uh uh offering and we're not sure if at any point they will be um but you know we do have this thing called over the air which you know we we reach uh you know a a much larger universe potentially than the wired and pay cable universe already we're you know sixteen percent of our viewers already use that as their as their um uh reception device without the aid of a paywall and and that's available to uh to those who want to uh quote stream us that way if you will and uh the the good news about that is there are far few competitors for eyeballs in in a in an over the air world then there are in a five hundred plus cable or satellite universe so um again we uh we we are in flex we have a lot of our agreements nailed down through twenty one and twenty two we do have some that will yeah uh end of this year and early next year and and that's where those conversations will will center around what's the best type of agreement uh for for both companies standard into great and then just one on political four years ago we kind of got a head fake at the last minute from the trump campaign in terms of not spending what was expected um i don't think any of us expect that to happen this time but when do you feel comfortable that there's not gonna be any negative surprises on the political spending side well i'm pretty comfortable in that right now i mean look at the amount of money that both camps have raised that the attendant packs and special interest groups have raised supporting those candidates as well as down down valley candidates um you know there are no guarantees in this business but it's close to the guarantee that i'll make is there'll be no negative surprise on political advertising that's a pretty good guarantee thank you cool now take our next question from zach silver with b riley okay great thanks for the question the first one is just if you can quantify the sequential improvement for core in july versus uh total two p twenty or even the performer year over year change so far in july and then and more broadly and i think it's a little bit related to steven's question you know the narrative out there has been at the macro environment and growth and streaming is going to accelerate the shift to add dollars from linear tv to connect to tv and streaming uh can you talk about how well positioned you are to address that if that narrative does turn out to play out um i'll let you address uh how how linear do you want to get on on guidance obviously we saw substantial uh sequential improvement in correct trends and versus not only june but the entire quarter um tom i dunno if you wanna add any more details to that but um i'll let you speak to that sure well i think uh what i'll say about july is obviously july was the basically better than the second quarter as a whole and july was better than the last month of the second quarter so sequentially things have gotten better and that trend continues into early q3 but as it relates to um additional streaming services um you know they're at some point there becomes kind of a sameness to them and and uh you know um it's it's all about the content if you have the content that people want they will find a way to consume you whether that's over the air or whether that's through a pay service or through a streaming service that we're paid to be on and without our services you have an inferior offering to the viewing blick is obviously demonstrated that local news is a product that people want and are willing to pay for and so i think we'll just stand by that uh you know it's it's a lot less noisy at the operating level than it is perhaps at the investor level about these streaming services you know is it a fragmenting universe but are they just taking from a from a wire you know from a from a uh a traditional uh ptv universe into a virtual ptv universe and if so and we're on both sides of that train exaction it's not uh you know it's not nearly the uh uh the noise that uh that it appears to be in the investment community so we're somewhat sanguine about it you know uh we we have a product that people want we're the largest producer of it in the country it's called local new and uh and we believe that product will stand the test of time as it has for the last forty years test of time yeah i think that makes sense and one more if i could uh does the i guess for tom does a target leverage ratio for this your contemplate uh any buybacks in the second half and can you remind us of where we are in resuming the references program thanks um it does i won't say how much of it um is out catered to stock purchases the way we think we we have an authorization left uh from the board we're currently not buying stock um but i would anticipate that to get revisited here in the not too distant future the way we think about it is really starting on labor day and and quite honestly that's probably not doing service to the fact that as perry mentioned july political revenue was very strong and we think all the will be as well we're rapidly transitioning out of this being a story um during the pandemic just about um poor advertising revenue and what's happening there the the other leg to to the tool from our perspective um distribution and revenue has been strong continues to be strong as perry mentioned we're on budget for the year we're on budget for the second we were on we were actually above budget for the second quarter we're on budget for the third order with regard to retransmission revenues and then the third leg of the stool is political and that's really going that candle is gonna get lit here right around labor day and run really hard for the two months of of september october in the first week of november so the free cash flow of the company will continue to uh go along nicely and then get turbo charged by free cash flow from political beginning around labor day i as i've said to other people i fully expect our um our capital allocation attitude to change from playing defense to playing offense sometime right around labor day we're not there yet but i can see there from here and when that happens then i would imagine we wouldn't sit here with an unnatural six hundred billion of cash on our balance sheet we deploy that by actually repaying debt and looking at stock purchases but that's a multi-variable equation tell me what the stock is around that time and i'll tell you what our appetite is right is that responsive yeah that's helpful thank you i just want to add to tom's comment about political if you most folks woke up this morning uh reading about the you know biden's uh buy that he's placing starting on september first in uh fifteen states well we we operate uh substantial operations in twelve of those fifteen states so uh just to point out that you know political will reach a crescendo uh around labor day that will continue on through the first week of november and uh and again with july results being above all of second quarter for political uh you know that's a pretty good uh pretty good measure i think of of what's yet to come and so we remain confident in our political guidance and as that story continues to prove then i think you'll see uh to i'll exercise more optionality around our cashboard that currently exists on the balance sheet got it thanks gary well now i'll take our next question from aaron once with a joy thank you guys thanks for having me on um a couple questions on the ad environment i guess first there's been some fits and starts in terms of covid cases uh in pockets of the country what in your markets that have been affected by that uh and i guess on a related note in terms of categories just given the importance of the auto category um anything you can give us in terms of how that rebounded is shaping up and what you're expecting from auto in the next couple months yeah auto uh has rebounded you know we're seeing better uh better pacing and better results in q3 than we did in q2 when dealers were shut down uh we're seeing certain of the oems move money around from market to market uh based on where they have cars and that's primarily affected some of the foreign name place but on the whole um i think the uh our expectations for auto are that it will be less down sequentially going forward as well most of core advertising um as it related to um covid i didn't know if you met how it affected the company uh or what what we're seeing in our markets um but i can give you a little color on both uh we have had a hundred and forty five uh confirmed cases in the company um since the beginning of the pandemic um remarkably out of a workforce of about thirteen thousand that that you know that of people that are out in the community um we've only had one hospitalization and that person is fully recovered um about sixty percent of our employees are working from the facility to which they're assigned we have another twenty percent that are reporting to work but not necessarily in the facility reporters meeting their crews in the field to go to their first assignment and things of that sort and we have another twenty percent that are uh that are uh are working remotely and uh you know i use the example with our board that you know everybody in tikka is reporting to work uh however nobody is populating our new york offices because of the the public trans rotation requirements and and they don't feel safe and there's certainly no mandate to do that and and so that's kind of a proxy for the country you know we keep tabs by every market as to uh you know various stages of reopening i would say that all of our markets have uh have some degree of reopening some more than others there have been some pauses in california in texas and others on on further reopening uh areas have been rolled back you know bars and and restaurants uh are not necessarily they got advertising categories with us to begin with hospitality continues to be uh uh a category where we see no spend uh to speak of um there is some interesting tourism ads that are going on like if you're texas come to arkansas and vice versa in oklahoma uh we've we're seeing some of that but hospitality for us is a sub two percent category that you know uh is not materially driving our top lines so aaron i don't know if that's the kind of uh flavor you were looking for but i'm happy to answer any more specific followup uh that's helpful um one last one for me and i i appreciate the time again uh you spoke to the importance local news and the ad revenues that come then attached to that to the overall revenue pie uh if we're thinking about the potential that maybe nfl football is delayed or college football doesn't happen in the fall how do we think about the flow through of that potential and what could mean to your revenue pie sure i'm i'm glad you asked that it's interesting at the local station level which is where we live all sports comprises about ten percent of our advertising revenue and and of that the nfl from prices about sixty percent of that ten percent so it let's just in real round numbers say that ad revenue support is half of our revenue and nfl is six percent of ten percent of that so we're talking about three points of revenue uh so from an advertising perspective because of the limited avails that the local stations get in in all of local sports or all of television sports that's not local um you know it's it's not that big of a contributor but obviously it has an outsized uh uh effect on viewership on promotional ability and i would say on the national psyche and on on people's morale uh obviously distributors are are very for sitting in live sports because they know live sports and live news drive viewership but from a pure financial advertising point of view it's uh it's not all that material to our top of bottom line okay perfect that's exactly what i'm looking for stay well guys thank you our next question will be from brian class with towards your bank hi i have two questions first wondering if you you could give us um some color on what you were seeing in terms of subscriber declines in your markets um curious how they compare to the overall industry and uh any color on advertising and distributor reception to news nation and uh any expectations for when you might see you know some incremental revenue lift from news nation thanks i'm a larry i'm going to agree with this scriber and then i'll talk about pm how's that sure um i would say our um experience with subscribers is not materially different than that of the um the mvpds obviously we are still getting an uplift for in the virtual mvpd so that the the traditional mvpd subscriber loss is somewhat recouped but certainly not all recruit by um by the virtual mvpds and as perry had mentioned obviously we've actor in in our budgeting process and then our guidance process you know and attrition rate for subscribers and a um a unit rate for our um for our revenue and as we mentioned that was basically in line for the second quarter and early returns for the third quarter are consistent with that expectation so not getting into specific subscriber decline numbers et cetera i would say that um we we see and feel the same thing that the um uh you know the the distributors do um it's just that our um you know our economics are a little bit different um because we've got um you know rate that helps us offset that um but it's consistent with our expectations as it relates to uh wg and america we have had and you know dana zimmer and her team have been out presenting and wgn america to every uh mvpd with which we already do business and also those that do not carry wgn uh wgn america and that's primarily in legacy next star markets uh and and we have an opportunity with renewals between now and the end of the year for an incremental approximately two hundred to two hundred fifty thousand subs that could add wg in america and these are smaller systems again where next car has a relationship but there we no tribute relationship that would've included wg in america so there was upside there um and and i would say that the reception from distributors has been positive uh particularly from those who have uh existing contracts and realized there's going to be a good value add for no additional cost uh during the term of the the current agreement we are uh distributed on uh at and t now um as the uh the only virtual mvpd system uh service that is offering wg in america we are efforting to uh to get distribution um uh at the launch or or shortly thereafter on other ott services and that will be a value add where wg and america is not currently distributed but uh the reception for both the advertising community and the distribution community has been positive because we're investing in a product that will add value to their business as well great thanks well take our next question from <unk> with benchmark thanks good morning <unk> left here after the strong prints and all the questions but uh i guess i'll ask you um one follow up to the prior para i don't know if you're willing to sort of you know good color on on sub-carriage incremental opportunity is there any way for us to think about sort of timing and higher thinking about the news nation impact itself relative to you uh either advertising or uh i guess ancillary with that um your comment on carriage we know it's gonna be self-funding obviously you have plans to kind of expand it so just any help kind of framing your thoughts uh on sort of the magnitude of that opportunity and then separately um you know obviously there's been a lot of noise lately uh in the digital world facebook twitter uh ad boycotts all of that fun stuff um you guys are the largest you guys have a pretty big network effect in a pretty strong digital portfolio yourselves is there any accrued benefits you guys or do you think that stays mostly in the digital bucket thanks i'll speak first to uh wgn america the uh we have uh i'm very impressed with the job that dave wrote him and his sales team have done in assembling uh uh advertisers for uh for the premier premier week of wgn america's news nation blue chip names and uh and at cost per points that are uh in excess of uh i'm sorry i should say cost for thousands uh that are in excess of fifty percent greater than what uh standard programming was generating alone um so that's uh a very positive initial indication we're trying to rework some of the existing buys into uh the news nation uh primetime offering and uh and so um what we could really use is you know an upfront or a fourth quarter scatter market to break but all of that said we do anticipate an incremental let's call it low um eight figure uh revenue contribution to wgn's ad revenue uh in the four months of the of the end of this year um and again given the science and scope of the operation that wouldn't be deemed to be material but we do even in these conditions expect you know a low a low eight figure uplift in gross revenue there and uh and distribution that will mostly come at the end of the year so will impact twenty twenty one more than this year there have been some incremental deals done already that will launch wgn america uh you know between now and the end of the year but i would say the vast majority of that impact would be felt um in uh in uh in twenty twenty one and again you're talking a potential uplift of you know a quarter of a million subscribers on a you know nielson reported i think seventy five million subscriber base so even that is incremental but it but it's all incremental and that's what we're here to do is drive incremental growth out of the assets that we own and then the thoughts on either facebook twitter as it relates to core political uh if that stays in the digital bucket or if you can pick some of that up yeah listen i i think the most direct uh transfer could be in political if people you know if certain platforms are refusing those ads that money has to go somewhere and you know without uh can questions to fund and without rallies to fund the the the one way to reach people to provide cast television i think we're seeing an evidence of that right now so i think that would be probably the the direct transfer you know with all the boy cats and all of that i i don't think you've seen a a substantial uh decline in uh in in digital revenue uh performance on those platforms um so um at this point the damage is more reputational than financial and we'll see you know um how do you the government that wants to get involved in taking a look and potentially regulating these companies more symmetrically with the way we're regulated but at this point i i i think the financial uh transfer outside of political uh to the best our knowledge is minimal got it super helpful thanks for the color in the next quarter thanks our next question will come from <unk> uh yes good morning thank you um a few questions um last quarter on your conference call i believe you guys said your retrans subs were down four four nine percent year over year um as you guys may know uh seem claire on their call right the four years said the second quarter of subs were down about seven percent um cleaning the benefit from the virtual side should i assume that you guys were down roughly about seven percent for the second quarter for yourselves is that reasonable slightly worse in the first yeah no should i so it's a little bit better than that then or can you just help me understand your uh i would i would say it's more consistent with the second quarter the second quarter i'm sorry you need more consistent with the first quarter down four four and a half oh i'm sorry with with um with what we announced uh the first quarter you're right first quarter okay so i wouldn't say it's down for crack i'm not gonna get the exact number i've already said that it's not down seven but it's closer to the previous um quarters results okay i appreciate that um can you help us um your tv advertising to a scenes for the month of august would you say that those are tracking better than the rate of decline if you're core advertising for that is tracking better than what you or what what july turn out to be i think it's a little we have very you know few days in august here i'm thinking you know it's a little too early to be making any comments with regard to that okay can you help us in maybe just i'm trying understand then what you're sort of budgeting or thinking that the rate of decline feed of core advertising could be down in the third quarter um maybe help like i think that's why we're not that's why we're not giving guide right i i it's gonna be down tell us what july yeah how much july was down if you would i think i told you it was down less again i'm not gonna give specific numbers um but july would down less than june and june was obviously if it's just math if the entire quarter was down thirty five percent and every every month within the second quarter got better then clearly june was down less than thirty five percent and july was down less than june that's kind of the extent of the forward looking guidance that we're gonna give as it relates to specific advertising revenue okay um maybe let me ask another question then um in this this virus situation that's going out there in the states with the virus cases have gotten dramatically worse here in the last several weeks if you guys in a material change in the core tv advertising um in those markets is there any significant change or you can talk talk about them no um and again you know cases in texas have gone i mean you know you have to we don't operate just in one area that you are in that you might be hearing that news from right so you've gotta look across a hundred and fourteen markets and look at you know those states and you know cases might you reported to be up thirty percent which could be a hundred cases in a in a state i mean you've gotta put all of these numbers into context but i would say no the evidence is in you know in in our results in july and our pacing in august and our pacing in september all substantially better than where we exited second quarter and then we performed them second quarter so you know the proof is in the numbers as tom says it's just math but you know we have not seen any and i think i just said this you know hospitality continues to be down autos and proving we don't get a lot of money from restaurants unless it's qsr and they're making mints through their drive through so uh you know things are we are seeing steadily improvements and even we're you know pausing and opening is better than not being open at all and that's that's kind of our worst case scenario in some of our markets and in others uh we don't have that you know this morning we're dealing with the aftermath but storms of the east coast from the carolinas into virginia and up into uh pennsylvania new york and flooding and those kinds of things and those are gonna be more you know temporary disruptors to businesses until they they can reopen then the pandemic and so it's it's situational and we deal in thirty eight states across the country and you've gotta add it all together but the is you know nothing other than business as usual is the way we deal with things and i think the results speak for themselves and my last question guys on the cost front you guys talk about performer costs in the second quarter down eighteen percent can you give us a little bit more to how we so we think about your cost trends for the third quarter i know you gave a figure there versus your budget for the third quarter here to somewhere one for the second quarter but just what sort of costs that you could help just help us a little bit think about that it may not repeat the call savings on third court you'd benefit from in a second thank you i really don't understand the question other than the fact obviously we had um guided to forty million dollars in cost takeouts in the second quarter which we believe you know which we over performed on that same number for the third quarter is twenty five million as we obviously some of those variable costs as advertising starts to return those costs go up some of 'em are discretionary that we will add back in we will travel more in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter we basically couldn't have traveled any less in the second quarter than we did so some of the discretionary costs will get added back in but that will be more than offset by um higher advertising revenues in the second quarter but specifically as it relates to um you know if you're looking year over year the majority of the uh synergies um taken out of this for june transaction have occurred so that won't change materialally sequentially q2 q3 over q2 and you'll have some added expense coming back in but that's the extent of some of the uh the put that's that's that's that's that's that's that's well thank you i appreciate that guys well now take our next question from john <unk> you can hear me having the problems like a lot of people in the neighborhood uh two quickies uh tom i think the uh twenty four bonds were callable two days ago and i hear nothing that means that not likely to be well again john i think that's consistent with our message that um you know in the next thirty to forty five days i think we will have a better um feel on actual political revenue coming in you know labor day and obviously same with um another month of core and we'll be able to start making um more aggressive decisions with regard to capital allocation in the you know obviously in the last um a hundred twenty days and probably in the next thirty days we're still gonna continue to take a pretty conservative um view on that but hopefully be able to flip the switch and become a little bit more aggressive um in the in in your return secondly um did i hear correctly that uh they're on track for mid teens reprint net returns growth uh this year and you mentioned that the growth the gross retrans is up high twenties proforma that that i have correctly gross high twenties net meetings so far this year our our uh retrans revenue growth has exceeded twenty percent that that is correct we have budgeted for nineteen yes well twenty eight in the second quarter um i forget what exactly the first quarter is we budgeted for mid teens growth in um net retrans for the entire year but so far we have exceeded that okay so net let's make retrains margins are down you know more than a little bit of this year is that correct no i i would say that they're actually up a little bit because we're we've included um a fair amount of probe subscribers that are non big four affiliates where our net retrans you know is it substantially an excess of fifty percent got it thank you very much good well now take our next question from jim <unk> uh thanks um during the early days of the pandemic uh there seemed to be a surge in or a private increase at least in usage and even sampling uh of broadcast and other video in uh categories that didn't take or didn't tend to outside so the court would be requested if you could request i'm not sure what happened there um so but i was wondering if any of that has proven sustainable or you would like to cancel this request please i'm sorry am i heard go ahead jim i think somebody's trying to either record or exit the call okay sorry but anyway i was wondering if any of the increases that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's few retrans uh negotiations uh done in the first half of the year we had one top ten uh that were you know we're pleased with the results on um i would say you know in my in my uh comments earlier i did court that you know our our viewership and i highlighted the eighteen to thirty four demographic you know obviously was up in april a hundred fifty one percent eighty three percent in may and eighty nine percent in june over the prior year our digital page views which were an excess of two point three billion for the quarter were one point one billion in april that was up a hundred thirty three percent and then in the month of june just by comparison our local websites were up sixty percent compared to the prior so um you know there is there is some covid fatigue i think uh but i also think there is increased interest in local news and we consider ourselves uh to be the last bastion of local news with the miniation newspaper and radio local coverage and content so um you know we do think that uh that there is sticky this to this you know uh the long tail will determine how much but um but people continue to turn to our newscast record numbers and it's amazing you use a tla in los angeles and wgn in chicago independent stations by and large but producing copious amounts of local news um are ranking number one in all the apart speeding all of the network o and os and virtually every newscast and that just speaks to the power of localism that you're not dependent on network lead in or lead out to to generate your audience you're doing it on your own and uh and we're particularly gratified by by that kind of execution producing those kinds of results okay and uh one last thing the uh i was wondering about the promotion efforts to create visibility for uh news nation as they had is you know coming to the floor and also it seems like uh cnn tended to fill a similar similar role to that which you're targeting uh where it tended to be unbiased uh maybe little less so these days and it they're in that era it would tend to be the place to go when something an event occurred but it uh some of the other news more part the newscast would politically would uh sort of gather the their base uh in more normal times so i'm wondering if if there's a way for you to position yourself to you know sort of get other at least that role and maybe you know maybe has something more sustainable and if this proof successful do you think you're broaden it beyond the three hour original timeframe well thanks you and there's a lot of there to unpack i'll i'll try and do my best with it here um you know obviously you know that is how cnn started i don't think anyone listening to this call think cnn is in that same place today uh from unbiased uh political lean uh as i've said before we have a staff of rhetoricians and two full-time staff that do nothing but check scripts and reporting for unconscious bias and bias in our writing and we've had very spirited discussions about that even in the rehearsals you know um we uh we we do think we will be that place to go for news that doesn't make a uh you know twenty two minute news hole in a network even news broadcast or much news on the the opinion based uh you know talk network um you know for example last night our rehearsals we did a story on the first women police chief in colorado springs and uh that's not a story you'd see every place else but again we've got our we've got the country divided up into six zones and we have zone producers and there their job is to know exactly what's going on in those zones in all of those newsrooms and what might be of interest to a national audience in addition to the a hundred and fifty people we hired in chicago correspondence that are also based in miami new york or dallas los angeles um and dc that report exclusively for the network as well as all the behind the scenes production folks that um that that we think we can give a a more representative view of america than perhaps what's c inside the new york uh dc uh beltway um so we think there's a purpose for that and there's a reason for that and uh the acceptance of that concept now it's it has been very uh enthusiastic it's now just on us to deliver as a relates to promotion um we have um secured something that none of the other uh networks news networks i think are able to compete with and that is uh to harness the power of a hundred and ninety six television stations across so that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's look at the annualized promotion value that the stations will be contributing on a dedicated basis it's something approaching a hundred million dollars uh we are layering on top of that on an annualized basis approximately twenty million dollars of uh outside promotion expense which primarily goes for um advertising on other cable networks because we're just a a channel change away at that point on uh national and syndicated radio we're also uh you know investing heavily in social media not only because of the app but to try and drive a younger demographic to an alternative news to asked and so uh we we think our promotion spending you know all taken together you know a nine figure amount of both cash and in kind contributions for the company are are another asset that uh will uh will hopefully drive success for this uh this effort and again it's you know it is a counter programming um opportunity in prime time and we're going to do our best to succeed there obviously if we are successful we would look at other day parts but we're taking much of a crawl walk run approach to this we want to get it right and uh and you know we will grow as fast as our success would allow us to grow so i think i'd leave it at that but you know we're we're very excited about the prospect of uh of introducing an alternative uh in crime time to entertainment sports and opinion programming and that the product will uh will reach a uh we'll we'll strike a cord and and resonate with the audience and then you know audience growth and advertiser growth will continue so um tune in it it launches on september first okay thank you capture it well and that does conclude our question and answer session for i might turn the conference back over to <unk> for any additional or closing remarks well thank you operator again we're uh we're very pleased at our progress and we're pleased at our strong financial position and we're excited about the launch of wg in america and in the advent of the political spending season that will all be upon us before our next call so we look forward reporting back to you uh shortly after election day with the uh the early results on all of those efforts and thank you very much for your time this morning thanks for joining yeah one second that does conclude today's conference we thank you all for your participation you may now
