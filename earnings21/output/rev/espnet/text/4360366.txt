financial measures reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release but in it's just supplement and other materials available in the investor section on our website and now i'd like to turn the call over to <unk> thank you abby good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today as we shared in our pre-released last week and again this morning we reported a small net loss for the quarter due to a high level of catastrophy losses and as we expected the loss in our non fixed income investment portfolio dan will have more to say about both shortly our underlying underwriting income of five hundred and seventy two million dollars three tax was up two hundred and fifty four million dollars over the prior year quarter benefiting from solid netner and premium and a three point five point improvement in the underlying a combined ratio to a strong ninety one point four percent the pandemic and related economic conditions have only a modest net impact on our underwriting results as i shared my prepared remarks last quarter it will be covid nineteen related loss activity that there will be some offsetting decline in losses to the people across the country sheltering in place for us in the quarter a hundred fourteen million dollars of direct losses and sixty three million dollars of of premium adjustments were about offset by initial estimates of favorable loss activity most of which is in short tail lines given the continued uncertainty we've taken a cautious approach to recognizing the net impact at covid nineteen related loss activity some industry observers are speculated about the aggregate level of insured and investment losses a rising out of the pandemic we don't doubt the losses will be significant but they won't be born evenly across an sure our manageable covid related insurance losses so far this year are a reflection of our disciplined approach to risk selection as well as terms of conditions and as we shared with you in some detail last quarter we manage our investment for with a similar regard to balancing risk and reward last quarter i commented on the potential future impacts the pandemic might have on each of our key lines of business i'll review that again with a quarters worth of experience in personal auto we've seen a meaningful drop off in auto frequency although that is moderating as economic activity picks up at the same time we've taken into consideration the potential for some offsetting impact in terms of auto severity due to factors such as collision occurring at higher speeds and driver distraction in workers' compensation covid related claims mostly related to healthcare workers and first response which do not represent a significant part of our local business also the frequency of those claims stabilized during the quarter which might be attributed to an improved supply of ppe and the healthcare community having the benefit of more experience with managing covid patients more probably beyond the healthcare sector data for some of the state workers comp systems suggest that the covid related claim rate is low relative to the infection rate that's likely partly attributable to the fact that the population most seriously affected by covid nineteen excuse older and it's not the workforce nonetheless in developing our law estimates we've taken into consideration that the potential for the delayed reporting of claims and additional claim activity associated with recent fighting infection rates as well as uncertainty related to the longer term implications of the disease as we anticipated some states have effectively expanded the scope of workers comp coverage by creating presumptions of compensability in most cases states have taken a thoughtful approach protecting workers appropriately but not unreasonably burdening the workers come conversation system where states have acted to expand compensability we've adjusted our loss estimates accordingly in terms of non covid workers comp losses we've seen the lower volume of workers comp claims as workers stayed home this will update as people get back to the workplace in addition to taking that into account we have contemplated that severity could be adversely affected by injured workers delaying treatment due to this at home work environment having said all that our experience is that there's a low level of workers comp claim activity associated with economic recessions during periods of elevated unemployment workers tend to be more motivated to stay at their jobs and the workforce tends to be more seasoned in management liability as we expected we are seeing the elevated level of claim activity typically associated with stock market volatility and workforce reductions the underlying combined ratio of this quarter and bond and specialty reflects that as well as other loss activity and we expect that the underlying combined ratio will continue to be elevated at this level or somewhat higher over the near term this is not the like the experience we had in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago nonetheless we expect the return from this segment will continue to be healthy turning to the surety business we've been pleased to see that work has continued on the vast majority of construction projects however the death and duration of stress in the economy continues to be risk factors the surety business the line will also be impacted by other factors such as the financial strength of the bonded firms the as i shared last quarter our high quality shared book was effectively stress tested in the two thousand and eight financial crisis and performed well and our underwriting approach has remained disciplined since that time in that regard so far we haven't seen anything that has caused us to change our surety loss estimates in terms of business interruption coverages under commercial property policies there's a fair amount of litigation challenging coverage as a minder our commercial property insurance policies that include business interruption including as a result of civil authority require losses to be caused by by direct physical damage to property from a covered cause of loss in addition our standard policy forms specifically excludes loss or damage caused by or resulting from a virus a few court decisions we've seen so far one in new york and one in michigan have both of help with physical damage requirements to make context of covid nineteen on the legislative front efforts to retroactively expand coverage for business interruptions seem to be diminishing finally the respect to liability coverages as people shelter in place we are seeing fewer commercial auto accidents and slip and fall type claims anecdotally we are also seeing some movement by the sneakers bar it's suba claims faster but it's too soon to know how significant that benefit might be we're also encouraged by states that have adopted covid-related liability protections and similar efforts that are underway in other states and at the federal level we shouldn't let frivolous lawsuits undermine the nations or every then the last we expect the plant is far to continue to be active turning to the quarter of the top line we're very pleased with our production results including the auto premium refunds we provided to our customers net written premium true by two percent as the impact of covid nineteen on insurance exposures was more than offset by strong renewal rate change in all three seconds in business insurance we achieved renewal rate change at seven point four percent the highest level since two thousand thirteen and close to the record level we achieved that year excluding workers' comp renewal rate changes double digits importantly retention levels remain strong in bonded specialty insurance net written premiums increased by three percent it's our domestic management liability business achieved a referable rate change on maintaining strong retention in personal insurance if including the other premium refunds net written premiums increased by six percent driven by strong retention and new business in both agency auto and agency homeowners in our agency homeowners business renewal premium change remains strong at seven point seven percent and we hit a record for new business let me take a minute to comment on the commercial rate environment before the pandemic struck there there were a number of industry-wide factors putting upward pressure on prices mainly increased volatility at weather related losses interest rates at historical lows and a growing recognition of higher loss trend in the liability lines all of those conditions persist a and now at another quarter with a very high level of weather related losses interest rates that are likely to be lower for longer and while it hasn't been a significant factor for us for reinsurance market that is hard to and on top of that the pandemic and related economic fallout at a sense of incremental uncertainty making this feel like one of those times not unlike in the wake of nine eleven in hurricane katrina when the market recalibrates risks with that as the background will continue to seek great games and manage other levels of profitability to improve the outlook for return i'll close by saying that i couldn't be more grateful to my traveler's colleagues for their grit and commitment to taking care of our co customers our business partners our communities and each other also the work they've done in recent years to advance our innovation agenda has equipped us with state of the art digital tools and other capabilities that make all the difference in this in five we were well prepared and from here we're well positioned free from financial and operational distractions will continue uninterrupted managing our business and investing for long term success ensure we're confident in our ability to continue to succeed through these uncertain times and to benefit from the strength of our franchise as the economy recovers and with that i'll turn the call over to dan thank you allen carlos of the second quarter was fifty million compared to core income of five hundred and thirty seven million in the prior year quarter the change resulted primarily from a higher level of catastrophy losses and as expected lower net investment income for the quarter the net impact related to covid nineteen is included in our underlying results not as part of our cat figure and was modest more on that in a minute our second quarter results include eight hundred fifty four million dollars of pre-tax cat losses compared to only three hundred and sixty seven million in last year second quarter this quarter's cats included severe storms and several regions of the united states as well as ninety one million of loss related to civil unrest regarding our property aggregate catastrophe xl tree for two thousand twenty as of june thirtieth we have accumulated about one point four billion of qualifying losses toward the aggregate retention of one point five five billion dollars the treaty provides aggregate coverage of two hundred and eighty million part of five hundred million dollars of losses above that one point five five billion attention the underlying combined ratio of ninety one point four percent which excludes the impacts of cats and p y d improved by three and a half points compared to ninety four point nine percent and last year second quarter the underlying loss ratio improved by more than four points and benefited from a lower level of non-cat weather losses favorable frequency and personal auto from the shelter in place environment net of related premium refunds and the impact of earned pricing and excess of loss trend the expense ratio of thirty one percent is eight tens of a point higher than the prior year quarter and above our recent run rate this change was as expected due to the reduction in premiums associated with the pandemics impact on the economy along with the premium refunds to our personal auto customers the net impact of covid nineteen and its related effects on the economy were modest in terms of our overall second quarter underwriting our top line was resilient excluding the premium refunds and personal insurance net written premiums increased by two percent driven by strong renewal rate change in all three segments that more than offset lower insured exposures in terms of operating expenses results were adversely impacted by modest increases in the allowance for bad debt and the approval for supplemental commissions those expense increases however were roughly offset by lower expenses in other categories for example travel costs were down as our employees continue to work primarily from home the economic impacts related to covid nineteen and also affected our underlying losses for example losses directly related to covid nineteen total one hundred and fourteen million dollars primarily workers comp and business insurance and management liability losses and our bond and specialty business on the other hand we experienced significant reductions in auto claims as there were fewer cars on the road during the second quarter and to a lesser degree recognized a benefit reflecting fewer traditional workers comp claims as more people worked from home as you heard from allen given the uncertainty in the current environment we took a cautious approach in estimating the net impact of covid-related losses we have recorded the estimated cost for all losses incurred through june thirtieth and including incurred losses for which claims have not yet been reported all losses have been recorded at our estimate of ultimate and the majority of the covid nineteen related insurance losses we have both in the first and second quarters are still sitting in our ibm reserves we have not recognized losses or benefits covid nineteen related in short events that we anticipate will occur subsequent to the end of the court taking a step back on a year to date basis the impact on our results excluding that investment income from covid nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about fifty million dollars pretax earnings prior year reserve development and personal insurance both auto and property loss came in better than expected for multiple accident years and brought in specialty insurance we saw larger losses than expected in management liability resulting in prior strengthening of thirty three million largely offsetting the favorable development in personal insurance business insurance there was no net prior year reserve development as better than expected loss experience in workers' comp and commercial property was largely offset by unfavorable results in our other casualty lines each of the movements this quarter was relatively small compared to the reserve base as you saw in our july fourteenth press release we expect the record subgregation benefits and our third quarter pyd of approximately four hundred million dollars pre-tax related to peach and e successful emergency from bankruptcy on july first as a reminder third quarter p i d will also include the results of our annual as best as review after tax net investment income decreased by fifty four percent from the prior year quarter to two hundred fifty one million dollars somewhat better result than we had previewed in our call last quarter the decrease was driven by our non fixed income returns where results for our private equity hedge fund and real estate partnership are generally reported to us on a one quarter lag accordingly the impact of the disruption and global financial markets that occurred in the latter half of the first quarter impacted our second quarter results as the broader markets have recovered in second quarter that should at least to some extent benefit our non fixed income results in the third quarter it's worth mentioning here that recovery may not be reflected in the private equity and hedge fund results as quickly as the downturns will given continued economic uncertainty fund managers will report their results to us and they take a more measured approach and not be as quick to right back up the evaluations they just mark down particularly in light of what may be continued channel prospects for the earnings and cash flows of the funds underlying investments fixed income returns decreased by twenty four million after tax as the benefit from higher levels of invested assets was more than offset by the decline in interest rates and the exchange as we chose to maintain a somewhat higher level of liquidity and held more short term investments than in prior quarters for the remainder of two thousand twenty we expected fixed income nii will decrease by approximately thirty to forty million after tax per quarter compared to the corresponding period of two thousand nineteen turning to capital management operating cash flows for the quarter of one point seven billion were again very strong all our cash little ratios were at or better than target levels and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity and slightly more than two billion well above our target level we call that in april we prefunded as we normally do five hundred million of that's coming due in november with a new thirty year five hundred million dollar debt issuance at two point five five percent so our holding company liquidity is temporarily elevated by that amount investment it's decreased as credit spreads tightened during this second quarter and accordingly our net unrealized investment gain increased from one point eight billion dollars after tax as of march thirty first to three point six billion dollars after tax at june thirtieth the justin book value for share which excludes net un wise investment james and losses was ninety two dollars and one cent at quarter end down in western one percent from year end and up two percent year over year we returned two hundred eighteen million dollars of capital to our shareholders this quarter by a dividends we did not purchase any shares during the quarter as we indicated in our first quarter earnings call our capital management strategy remains unchanged with the ongoing economic uncertainty and with hurricane season upon us it still feels to us like holding onto a little more capital is preferable to holding onto as a list until there's more clarity on the state of the economy we may buy back some shares in the coming quarters or we may continue to choose to buy none coming back to reinsurance for a moment coming direct your attention to slide nineteen of the webcast presentation for a summary of our july first renewals the structure of our main cat reinsurance program is generally consistent with the prior year we renewed our northeast cat treaty effective july first actually similar terms and pricing that was up only slightly on an exposure adjusted basis our cat bonds long point re three is now in the third year of its four year term in the annual reset for the two thousand twenty hurricane season the attachment point was adjusted from one point seven nine billion to one point eight seven billion while the total cost of the program was flat year over year a more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage including our general cat aggregate xl treaty it covers an accumulation of certain property losses advising for multiple occurrences is included in our ten q which we filed earlier today and in our two thousand nineteen 10k lastly let me take a minute to address thoughts on our top line going forward looking at premium volume we expect to experience the impacts of economic disruption how much of an impact we feel and for how long will depend on the extent in duration of the negative economic impacts related to the pandemic okay because earned premium typically like written premium we expect to feel the effects on an earned basis beyond the end of the year now it said last quarter we do not intend to take disruptive action expense actions in response to what made proved to be a short term impact on premium audience accordingly in coming quarters the expense ratio will likely remain somewhat elevated compared to the corresponding periods of two thousand nineteen through the expected impact on earned premiums now i'll turn the call over to greg for a discussion of business insurance thanks dan let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to all my travelers colleagues as well as our agent and broker partners for continuing to provide exceptional service our customers during these unprecedented times as for the quarter's results business insurance had a loss for the quarter of fifty eight million dollars due to lower net investment income and hire to task for people losses as well down and down discuss the combined ratio of a hundred seven point one percent included more than ten points of catastrophe impacted by both weather related losses and civil unrest the underlying combined ratio of ninety seven percent improved by zero point four points reflecting a zero point two point improvement in each of the underlying loss ratio and account ratio the net impact of covid nineteen and related economic conditions was modest turning to the top line net written premiums were three percent lower than the prior year quarter due to the impact of the economic disruption on insured exposures thanks to excellent execution by our field organization these impacts were largely also up by strong renewal rate increases and high retentions turning to domestic production we achieve strong renewal rate change on seven point four percent while retention remains high as eighty three percent the renewal rate change of seven point four percent was off almost four points from the second quarter of last year and more than a point from the first quarter of this year not withstanding the persistent downward pressure in workers' compensation pricing we continue to achieve higher rate levels broadly across our book as rate increases in all lines other than workers' compensation we're meaningfully higher during the quarter as compared to the second quarter of last year we achieved positive rate and about eighty percent of our middle market accounts this quarter which was up from about two thirds in the second quarter of last year importantly we've achieved this progress in a highly segmented manner and with retention remaining strong that these were levels our rate change continues to exceed loss trend even after about a half a point increase to our loss trend assumption new business of four hundred and seventy three million dollars was down ten percent from the prior quarter new business flow was down which we attribute largely to disruption caused by the pandemic new business was also impacted by a continued focus on discipline risk selection underwriting and prices these production were all reflect superior execution by our field organization in a very challenging environment as for the individual businesses and select renewal rate change was up to two point one percent making the six consecutive quarter where we're all rate was higher than the corresponding prior year quarter while retention was strong at eighty two percent the headwind from workers' compensation pricing is most pronounced in the select business new business was down significantly driven of economic disruption caused by the pandemic while the current environment is challenging we're confident that we're well positioned in investing in the right strategic capabilities to properly grow this business over time in middle more renewal rate change was up to seven point nine percent while retention remains strong at eighty six percent the seven point nine percent was up almost four and a half points from the second quarter of two thousand and nineteen and one and a half from the first quarter of two thousand and twenty new business of two hundred and fifty five million was down from the prior quarter driven by both economic disruption and our continued focus on discipline risk selection underwriting and price to sum up we believe our meaningful competitive advantages including our strong distribution relationships and our talent and expertise position us well to navigate through these uncertain times and continue to serve our customers and agent and broker partners with that i'll turn the call over to soft thanks great bond and specialty delivered solid returns and growth in the quarter despite the impacts of covid nineteen and really related economic conditions segment had come with seventy two million a decrease of one hundred two million from the prior year court as dan mentioned the combined ratio of ninety three point eight percent reflects unfavorable prior year reserve development in the quarter as compared to favorable p y d in the prior year quarter and a higher underlying combined ratios underlying combined ratio of eighty eight point one percent increase seven point one points from the prior year quarter primarily driven by the impact of higher law estimates for management liability coverages about half of which with due to covid nineteen and related economic conditions remaining half of the increase is due to a few smaller drivers such as elevated claim activity under employment practices liability for averages and ransomware losses under cyber policies turning to the top line never written premiums grew three percent for the quarter reflecting strong growth and our management liability and it or national business is partially offset by lower charity production in our domestic management liability business we are pleased the renewal premium change increased to seven point eight percent this march the seventh consecutive quarter where our pc is higher than the corresponding prior year court is alan noted renewal rate change was a record for the quarter while retention remained at a historically i eighty nine percent similar to business insurance our pc in the quarter was also impacted by lower insurance exposures these production results demonstrate the effect of execution of our strategy to pursue rate where needed while maintaining strong retention of our high quality portfolio we will continue to pursue rate increases where worked domestic management liability new business for the quarter decreased thirteen million reflecting the disruption associated with covid nineteen in our thoughtful underwriting in this elevated risk and by domestic security net premium net written premium was down twenty four million in the corner reflecting the impact of covid nineteen which slowed public project procurement and related bond demand international bs i posted strong growth in the quarter with record rate in our uk management liability businesses so bond and specialty results remain resilient despite the challenges brought on by covid nineteen these results reflect the excellent work of our agents brokers and employees who have adapted to operating in new ways to continue to provide leading pro and services to our customers we feel confident about our ability to navigate through this challenging environment and continue to deliver strong returns over time and now i'll turn it over to michael to discuss personal insurance thanks tom good morning everyone personal insurance segment income for the second quarter of twenty twenty was ten million down from eighty eight million in the prior year quarter for and by a higher level of catastrophe losses and lower net investment income these impacts were partially offset by an improvement in the underlying underwriting game our combined ratio for the quarter was one hundred one point three percent an increase of one point one points as a twelve and a half point increase in catastrophe losses was largely offset by a ten point six point improvement in the underlying combined ratio the underlying combined ratio benefited from lower non catastrophe weather related losses and lower automobile losses net of premium refunds the increase of two point six points on the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the reduction in net or premiums resulting from the auto premium funds turning to the top line excluding the impact of premium refunds of two hundred and sixteen million net written premiums grew six percent agency homeowners and other net written premiums were up in impressive thirteen sent an agency automobile net premiums were up three percent excluding premium refunds agency automobile delivered strong results with a combined ratio of eighty five point seven percent for the quarter so loss ratio improved over twelve points while the underwriting expense ratio increased by about four points the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was primarily driven by the impact of the premium refunds i described earlier the underlying combined ratio of eighty four point two percent improve nine point six points relative to the prior year quarter continuing to reflect improvement and frequency primarily due to fewer miles driven as a result of the pandemic data from our intelligence i have auto telematics program indicates miles driven were down significantly from pre covid nineteen levels during the second quarter reaching a weekly low point in in early april and partially rebounding as the economy has started to reopen in response to our improved auto loss experience we implemented a stay at home auto premium credit program for personal automobile customers in the us the program provided a fifteen percent premium refund on april may and june frame an agency homeowner is another the second quarter combined ratio was one hundred thirteen point nine percent nine point four points higher than the prior year quarter due primarily to higher catastrophes partially offset a lower underlying combined ratio historically the second quarter is our highest catastrophe quarter this quarter we experience significant storm activity resulting in thirty four points of catastrophe losses an increase of twenty one points compared to the prior year quarter where catastrophes were relatively low the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was eighty one point four percent down over eleven points from the prior year quarter driven primarily by were non catastrophy weather related losses the majority of the improvement is due to elevated non-cat weather in the prior year quarter non catastrophe weather related losses this quarter were also better than our assumptions turning to quarterly production our domestic agency results were solid despite the challenging environment resulting from covid nineteen and its related economic impacts our retentions remain strong quotes and new business were up versus a prior year quarter and we remain pleased with our policies in for growth agency automobile retention with eighty five percent and new business increased seven percent from the prior year quarter renewal premium change was one point five percent as we continue to moderate pricing given the improved performance in our book over the past few years agency homeowners another delivered another very strong quarter with retention of eighty seven percent renewal premium change of set one point seven percent and a seventeen percent increase in new business as we continue to seek to improve returns while growing the business higher new business levels again benefited from the successful rollout of our quantum two point oh product now available in over forty markets during the quarter we continue to deliver new capabilities and products to our customers and distribution partners we introduced quantum home two point oh and four new states including california in addition we launched in tele drive two point oh which adds distracted driving monitoring to our auto telematics product and delivers significant improvements of the user experience and after reaching our goal of planting one million trees for cut to my enrollment in paperless billing we extended our partnership with american forest to plant another five hundred thousand trees by earth day twenty twenty one to recap personal insurance is off to a strong start in the first half of the year for in light of a challenging environment i'm proud of our team's efforts to continue to work together to meet the needs of those were privileged to serve while investing in the business for the future now i'll turn the call back over to abby thanks michael before it begins q and a there's one topic that we expect might be on people's minds so we thought we would kick off q and a by addressing it so before we open up the line i'd like to turn the call back over to dan thanks adam there's been some discussion by industry observers about the timing of the recognition of covid related losses so let me reiterate that our reserves reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses incurred at of the balance sheet date and applying accounting principles we would not record a reserve for a loss that has not yet occurred as of the balance sheet date using auto claims as an example at the beginning of the year we have an assumption as the body of claims we will see over the course of the year and what the average cost of those claims will be but when we report our second quarter results including our balance sheet loss reserves as of june thirtieth both reserves do not include estimated amount for auto accidents that will occur at thanksgiving or on new year's eve those would be fourth quarter events and accordingly they will be recognized in our fourth quarter results the same principal applies when we consider losses related to covid ninth team while only some losses have been reported to us so far the losses we booked in both the first and second quarter reflect our estimate of the ultimate amounts that will pay for all losses and related costs that have been incurred as of june thirtieth including those for which we have not yet received a claim in fact as i said earlier the majority of the covid related insurance losses we have booked through june thirtieth are still sitting in our ibm our reserves that said the pandemic is clearly not over in tens of thousands of new infections are being confirmed in the united states each day it is foreseeable that a healthcare worker for example who to this point has not contracted covid nineteen will become ill from covid nineteen as a result of their job duties in december but again that loss activity will be included in our fourth quarter results similarly would not advance the recognition of any continued favorability from lower frequency and non-co it will for comp clients finally i'll remind you that on a year to date basis setting aside net investment income the impact on our results from covid nineteen and its related effects is a net charge of about fifty million pre-tax and with that upper we're ready to take questions thank you at this time if you'd like to ask a question press star one on your telephone to withdraw your question press the pound key please wait while we compile the questions your first question comes from the line of michael phillips but morgan stanley please go ahead thank you good morning everybody um thanks thanks for the clarification uh dan on that last comment so that's helpful um i guess i wanna try to get our arms around this uh business insurance and and and margins and pricing um you know trying to kind of pull out the effect of covid you said covid was pretty modest in a quarter of pricing what's clearly very strong um yeah yeah core margins improve or forty bills or twenty bills on the wall side so i guess it's trying to understand it is does that mean you know and and you and now you gave lots of great commentary on pricing um does that mean that the current level pricing still isn't enough to expand more today or um kind of how do we think about that versus the level of conservatism that might be baked into the to the current numbers yeah michael good morning is allen um i'll i'll i'll start to keep i can be a response to what's on your at the current levels of you know written rate is is an excessive of loss trend so you know looking nearly at those factors we we are on a written basis expanding margins is that is that what you're getting at but it is yeah it it is i guess if you know in business interruption you had twenty basis points of improvement so um you know not as much as maybe one would expect in the level of pricing and so you know that's what i'm trying to get my arms around yeah so you know as always there are a number of factors that are driving the underlying combined ratio in the quarter and that's true true for any business so you've got you've got weather so year over year that was that was better and in this quarter sort of within a normal ver within the normal level of variability we would expect for that you've got the earned impact of rate that as i as i said on both a written and earned basis uh rate is is ahead of loss trend uh we've had improved performances in some business got some some impact of covid it was modest but not zero uh you know you've got the year over year uh that sort of ongoing carry on impact of of social inflation that i'll call old news what you know the what we've recognized in the prior periods and that continues to roll through um so you know those those are you know we're given given the relative stability we're not gonna quantify the pieces but essentially those are the pieces okay no thank you that that's helpful thanks um i guess but didn't didn't see mention um and i guess this is good news didn't see mention of anything on the commercial auto side for for p y d and so maybe could you speak to kind of that piece and does that mean that there's been possibly some leveling off of the paid activity that's been part of the concern there it's like well it's it's dan um yeah as we had last quarter so we had some movements in pyd some you know some puts in takes um some continued good news in comp some continued pressure and the other liability lines they're worse all adjustments in commercial auto in the general liability lines in cmp but as i said in my remarks relatively modest compared to compared to those reserve bases okay thank you your next question come from line of ryan <unk> with auto research please go ahead hey thanks good morning um i just wanted to get a better feel for just you know forget about the net benefit uh from the covid just from the direct losses alone um or the direct impact what was the uh the hit that that had in business in production on the combined ratio this is direction specifically or business insurance i'm sorry i'm sorry business insurance without without considering the offsetting benefits what was just the um the the direct loss impact or direct it impact on that number yeah ryan is stand i don't think we're gonna give the pluses and the minuses but within the within the we told you that there was a hundred and fourteen million of directly related charges and all that included some uh some charges for the management liability coverages and bond and specialty the majority of what we took came through business insurance okay and then in terms of thinking about the benefits that were i think in the pre-announcement you said it was mostly short tail lines uh so should we take that to me i mean first of all outside of the short tail lines are you seeing actual to expected look a little bit better in some areas in terms of frequency and is that not something and if so is that something that you're not recognizing yet you're being conservative and waiting to see if that continues to be the case yeah right then again so we are for sure seeing some some favorable indications relative to what you would otherwise expect in this current environment and when we look at that there was too much favorability to simply say zero is the right reaction um but as allen said in his comments and as i tried to reiterate in mind i think we've been very cautious in terms of the degree to which we'd recognize any good news uh in anything other than the short tail lines but there's some because it's it's very apparent in the data and then just one uh one more real quick um i was i guess a little bit surprised exposure growth held in i think especially in select lines retention is only declined modestly you know how should interpret that is retention is it capturing cancellations or is that modest dip you know mostly a function of you guys taking more rain i'm just trying to figure out how to interpret those numbers that seem relatively modest given what's happening in the macro landscape yeah ryan let me take this is correct let me take both of those in the order that you took number one in terms of exposure change if you're looking that relative to middle market that's really a product mix dynamic in the select business we have the for us of the premium two product cmt and workers comp in the cmt product the rating on that is driven more off the property than the gl and so you know we're continuing to see pricing and inflationary pressure on the property and so there's some inflationary impact that that impacts on the cmp product and so you don't see as much of a drag on exposure on select that you do on middle market where the gl product is is more on a standalone rated basis uh and then the retention overall uh for select you know we we've certainly put our estimate of what we see in terms of uh you know business uh insultancy bankruptcies and that's all inside the eighty two percent number thank you your next question that's great that's great that's great that's great thanks greg if i heard you correctly in your prepared comments you talked about a sixty basis point increase in loss trend and that's what you can flush that out a little yeah we we look at lost trend every quarter and across the full portfolio and that's obviously a headline number uh what we did this quarter as we looked at you know the the impact of the new economy that we see in front of us we also look at some of this social uh in place and our liability dynamics that dan just talked about uh when we roll that all up in aggregate we we we believe we've got a fifty basis points increase in our loss trend in front of us the thing i'd add to that myers that that is reflected in the you know underlying combined ratio we reported for the quarter as as is a a piece of that that would be touched up from the first quarter okay perfect that last question is that what we're looking for yeah um second question i guess with worker's compensation being the most vulnerable to associate you know pressure um does that impact rate need on the expense ratio side say the question again i'm trying to understand i know that in general work with compensation pricing has been coming down because in as the experience has been good uh but we seem to be seeing a fairly significant um exposure unit headwind and i'm trying to get my arms around what that implies for indicated pricing yeah you know my there's a of a regulatory component to pricing as you know and it tends to be you know a little bit backward looking and it and it sort of factors in the overall profitability of the line which is as you know has been has been very favorable over the years and that'll continue to be the case so you know clearly you know exposure will be will be one impact on profitability today which will impact pricing tomorrow but it's really hard to isolate anyone anyone factor and its impact on profitability because you know everything goes in you've got you know you've got you start with your expiring rate and then you've got you know what whatever the rate change is and you've got exposure change you've got you know loss trends things like that so um it's it's definitely a factor it's hard to isolate you know extent of the impact okay understood thank you very much yeah next question comes from the line of elise greenson with wells fargo please go ahead good morning what are you good morning could you hear me no we hear you now hi sorry thank you um in terms of business insurance i would hoping for the covid nineteen losses um and i recognizing response to an earlier question maybe you aren't giving to the loss impacts in business insurance specifically by line but could you give us a sense of where you saw the majority of your covid losses that's ignoring the favorable impact in the second quarter just specifically within business insurance yeah at least so so that's what i had tried to do so we took a hundred and fourteen million across the enterprise indirect indirect covid losses none of that was in personal insurance there was some component of management liability within bond and specialty insurance which tom described and going through their combined ratio but the majority of those dollars came through business insurance at least are you asking for a breakdown by by product line yeah i was hoping by product line even if not in terms of dollars you could just give us a sense of which business insurance product so the majority of your covid losses yeah the the largest line for sure is workers comp um some some property losses uh both domestically and and internationally uh and then drips and drops i would say in other lines but those are those are the two drivers with cop by far being the largest at least i'd point you to my prepared comments where i did share that you know there was a modest net impact when we look at the adding on the favorable frequency on some of those lines also okay thanks and then my second question um is maybe a follow up on the prior question on workers comp um we've heard uh you know a few folks in the industry it seems like starting to point towards the bottom of comp in terms of just the pricing dynamics there but if i you know go back to your comments throughout the call it doesn't sound like you guys are you know thinking that the you know weight clients that we see in that business or you know close to coming to an end um so if you could just help us think about workforce comp in terms of the pricing dynamics there and whether you know we might hit an inflection and i'm not just talking twenty twenty perhaps you know into twenty twenty as well yeah at least that's a great question when you when you look at the information coming out of some of the rating beers and when we look at our own you know we would say that we are sort of after near a bottom in worker's comp pricing okay um that's helpful and one last numbers question could you give us um you said that they were small numbers but is there could you give us a sense of the dollars in terms of the adverse development within um general liability and commercial multi in the quarter yeah we're not gonna do that at least they're all pretty modest okay thank you i appreciate the color thank you your next question comes on of david <unk> with every car please go ahead hi thanks good morning um and dan i guess i i you know i i appreciate the comments um that you made uh just before the q and a but i guess i'm just wondering if if you could give us sense of you know how you are thinking about covid related adverse impacts throughout the rest of the year uh you know just looking through your portfolio of exposures and thinking how it might be affected by covid even if a haven't occurred yet in the first half and you have the exposure and you think there's a possibility that there could be a loss on it just wondering to get some some thoughts there i figured i'd take a shot at that david good morning in town let me let me start with that and if i miss anything else like that to take it up we're we're not we're not gonna forecast your future losses our obligation under gap is to report you know the the you know incurrent and and and unreported losses as of the balance sheet date and that's what we've done i it's it's hard to forecast the future there's some uncertainty we don't know the trajectory of the disease we don't know you know when we're gonna have a vaccine we don't know uh you know what the outlook for the economy is and and frankly it's you know probably the the uncertainties for the economy have the biggest impact on uh of of the pandemic on on us um but i i i do think it's relevant to and so why we pointed it out a few times that our our net losses in the first half of the year were net charges were about fifty million bucks putting aside uh the investment side um and and we've you know put up that net number with a with a high degree of caution so i i can't i can't give you a number you know i tried in my sort of line by line review to tell you some of the facts that we think about but i you know i think you know it's it's not it's not irrelevant to that assessment to think about our experience in the first half of the year okay great that that's helpful appreciate that alan and then just just one more so excluding workers comp the renewal rate change so it was pretty strong you said double double digits wondering if we get a finer point put on that and then just sort of how that compare hours versus the last few quarters uh and and also you know sort of thinking about i and i i think dan uh you had mentioned you know you're looking at loss trend of five percent now and what data thinking and that's i what would be comparing to the seven point four percent renewal rate change that you got in the quarter yeah i think that's the right stand i think that's the right way to think about rate versus trend and that's about that's the ballpark i think we said previously that trend was around four and a half percent in bi and we're taking it up about about a half a point uh in the current quarter but you gotta look at that in in relation to the pricing momentum uh as well and i think correct to correct me if i'm wrong but the the pricing momentum you see in this quarter is is a reflection of is a reflection of the strength of the market and the continued need for race yeah the only thing i'd add there to your point you know outside of comp all of our products were positive uh and so you know we we feel great about that execution and and mostly the changes line up with whatever the rate need is also okay great and if i could just sneak one more in on the the adverse develop and in general liability uh hoping to get a little bit more color in terms of what you saw in the quarter uh that i guess brought you to to make that change cause i had thought that you know most of the courts were close during the quarter i would think the page would be you know nothing really accelerated during the quarter or was it more just a view of yeah or was it more just a ongoing review that resulted in the change there it's more the latter and remember as we're doing reserve reviews especially in long tail lines like those you're looking more backwards at at your data so the actual loss environment of you know may and june we're aware of it but it's not really you don't have enough time to gather all that data and fully factor it into the reserve view that you're making at that time so a little more of that is still backward looking in terms of where things had developed say through the first quarter and again the standard again the standard note in history marks those were those were you know relatively small movements yes great understood thank you thank you yeah next question goes to line of the you some with piper sandler please go ahead uh you hit the big ones for me but one just quick one um from an investment perspective uh you know do you have expectations that we would see increased defaults as well come through and i guess that people see and realize um and is that sort of booked into the investment expectations that you gave us this quarter as well i'm thinking actually the fault that we might see from the recession yeah you know we gave a fair amount of detail and did a fair amount of commentary on you know the construct of the investment portfolio and and our comfort level with you know the the way we thoughtfully uh invested and and we've given you an update of that investment detail again in the appendix of the webcast presentation uh this quarter so i i wouldn't say more than we said i think last quarter in turn of feeling really good about the way we've managed risk on on the asset side of the balance sheet clearly we're aware of and looking and looking at and have a regular process to assess credit impairment and default rates and all of that stuff is baked into our numbers but it's really it's really not a big big impact on i was given the thoughtful investment approach in the first place because uh as ratings migration had much of an impact yet um if at all um on the capital calculations for you guys uh no it is not great no thank you thanks paul your next question comes to a line of brian meredith with you yes please go ahead yes thanks just two quick ones here um first one what was the impact of premium adjustments on the bi um written premium this quarter at conference mp i'm not sure i understand that question brian is yeah i mean like for workers like like reevaluating um like uh like what like employment stuff is on workers' comp you know usually you do it in the fourth quarter but were there any kind of you know early ones where you adjusted premium kind of to reflect what um what's gonna look like for the year that's what i think so i wouldn't say we normally do it in the fourth quarter i think what you're referring to maybe is we normally do it at the when the policy period has has ended like you grew up there there has been some and we've been open to it there's been some more requests by customers to do some of that mid-term but all of that's baked all of that's baked into our production statistics and the written premium numbers will be reported for the quarter brian and i think this break out that one piece uh okay thanks and then the second just quick question just to understand um the fifty basis points of increase in trend in the bi is that inclusive of what you're seeing with respect to covid nineteen and maybe the benefits or adverse stuff you're seeing on covid nineteen or is that more related to what's going on with just general kind of tort inflation and some of the increase you saw in your gl reserves and your cmp reserves uh i think we're we consider everything brian and and included in there and there are some puts in takes and that of the puts in takes was a half a point increase to the trend great and and just on that following on that alan you made some comments about maybe some favorable stuff having the court system as far as um um some you know early quick settlements but in general what your kind of take on what's going on with tort right now um could we potentially see an increase in tort inflation you know as a result what's going on with with covid nineteen yeah i mean i think we we certainly could and that's one of the reasons why we're such big opponents of liability reform i think it's important in terms of making sure we're protecting the nation's recovery from the pandemic um you know i i i think you hear a lot of rhetoric out there on that topic um but you know every everything everything we see and everything we're anticipating is in that loss trend of great thank you thank you and we have time for one more question coming from the line of jimmy both with jp morgan please go ahead hi good morning so first i had a question on just the commercial auto business if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of um frequency is that picking up as traffic's been increasing recent and then relatedly just your views on the rate adequacy in that line um given that you've been raising prices for a while or do you think rates need to go up for this uh this is go order this is greg yeah we certainly have seen some favorable frequency activity um as the shelter at home has taken place certainly not to the levels of personal insurance uh and just as a reminder in in commercial auto it's a little unique and personal where we do have layoff credits or you know premium credits when there's limited use and so um you know there's a slight offset as we see that frequency we have mechanisms to give that to give that back now as the economy is starting to reopen we're seeing that frequency my right okay and on the personal auto side are you assuming or expecting additional refunds um in the third quarter as well um so we don't we don't have further refunds planned in the personal auto uh you know i think i think like many we're looking forward at what rate adequacies over time and looking at more traditional mechanisms like rate filings uh to make sure that rates in line with loss trend and loss costs and personal on the refunds really were a were a mechanism to respond to acute an acute issue in the early days of the pandemic is sort of the way we're thinking about it okay and then just lastly you mentioned a majority of the covid losses were related to workers comp um you didn't really mention anything about business interruption and i'm assuming those losses were pretty modest but is that more because you haven't seen a lot of claim submission or is it just your view you have seen submissions what your view is that those claims are uninsured given the policy language yeah we we've certainly seen some submissions and and there's some you know claim activity around it and even some litigation around it um as as we've noted we've got um provisions in our policies that that we think um make that coverage in applicable and and so we we don't expect many of those claims uh actually to pay out it stands one one related comment to that even where we don't expect that all to pay the identity on the loss we have acknowledged in our reserves the fact that we'll spend some money defending against claims that come in for for business for business interruption okay and and on on covid is that the line where you see the most uncertain see in terms of claims given what happens on in terms of litigation activity or are there other lines where there's not a lot of clarity based on what's happened so far you know i don't think there's a i don't think there's a lot of uncertainty around business interruption i mean certainly there's some cuz there's some litigation and there's always uncertainty when you have litigation but you know we we've got the requirement for direct physical damage we've got two courts that have upheld that so far um and and we've got a specific virus exclusion in our standard policy forms that we we don't actually see a lot of uncertainty there and and we don't expect you know that to be a a material loss contributor for us okay thank you thank you i will mal tell you i will now turn the call back over to addie for closing room thank you all for joining us this morning appreciate it um as always if there's any follow-up please uh get in touch with investor relations and we're happy to answer your questions um be well and uh have a good day thanks this concludes today's conference call you now disconnect
