at the end of the third quarter we are working diligently to manage revenue at the property and note that occupancy has recently increased to eighty three percent long longer term we believe that occupancy or rental rates at the property will return to pre covid levels given trabecca house is attractive in this from a pricing standpoint compared to other luxury buildings in the surrounding neighborhood the flapish governance complex and broken of the wealth in the third quarter from a revenue standpoint as it is throughout the pandemic the property maintained high occupancy ending the

twenty nineteen partially offset by decline in least occupancy and residential rental rate et cetera back a house property on the expense side to year over year changes were as follows property

posting your question please pick up your handset of listening on speaker phone to provide optimum sound quality please hold while we pull for questions and your first question is coming from craig <unk> craig your lines live to yeah hi um i just wanted to confirm guys did you say that um outside of tribeca where you gave the update that that occupancy had improved at eighty three percent uh you mentioned flat bush that that all the other properties had seen and where from a three hundred eighty to six hundred ten basis point in occupancy uh since the third quarter yeah yeah hi craig how are you when at the end of the second quarter some of the properties as we said aspen ten west at clover house they were all in the mid ninety percent occupancy range ninety five to ninety seven percent by the end of the third quarter they had dipped a bit to ninety percent but since the end of the third quarter between then in september and today we see a bump back up of those proper is anywhere from three to four to five percent so the s in ten west in clubhouse properties currently or least ranging from ninety two to ninety five percent okay great and um i just wanted to follow up on um and how how how have rents trended basically flat done here in the in the in the fourth quarter or has there been any rent concessions to get those folks back did you wanna talk to that sure um so the rents have pretty much stayed um a drop below what they were prior simply because we're trying to recapture occupancy so that we're well you know positioned to when the market does come back to start pushing rent again so for now we are doing the best we can and making sure that we don't lose any opportunities to rent apartment so there's a slight down downtake in the rent per square foot because of that got it and uh and and just one more for me um you know are you tracking or able to track whether um you know as the folks moved out from second to third quarter are they are they staying in market or are these people that are basically just exiting the markets uh maybe they'll come back to important feature but are no longer in the greater new york msa um to answer that again without exact detail numbers um the answer is a significant amount of them are moving out of the cities some of them depending on the property are moving to let's say second homes that they have in the suburbs um many of them tell us when on the way out they say you know we wish this didn't come to this we we hope to be back soon we really like you know the property and we're looking forward to when things get back to normal so we can return to the city okay well that's that's encouraging uh that's it for me thanks guys if there are any remaining questions or comments please indicate so now by pressing star one okay your next question is coming from buck horn buck your line's live yeah hey thanks hey mike could you uh just call what what what the bad debt expense was in the quarter i don't know if you break that up any operating expenses absolutely uh as a refresher in the second quarter as you as you know we took about a six hundred thousand dollars bad debt expense and out into the third quarter here again given the high collections rate collection rate as judges said we're still in the sort of in the high nineties uh so what we've seen is actually to date pretty good and strong performance even as the pandemic lingers uh all in all in the third quarter we took a approximate six hundred sixty thousand dollars charge for bad debt so about a ten percent increase over the second quarter but again given everything that that's been going on uh with the pandemic i think we're pleasantly surprised and continue to see uh collections hold on overall okay if there are any remaining
