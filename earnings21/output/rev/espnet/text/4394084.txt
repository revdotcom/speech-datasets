quarter full year revenue growth was twenty three percent physical twenty twenty was our second consecutive year of strong growth of increasing profitability solid cash flow and while strengthening that underlying foundations of oem production contracts and recurring revenue that support our continued success based on this performance our cash on hand and our con things in continued success in september the board of directors declared a special sixty five cent for share dividend we were able to receive these achieve these results well for two our employees partners and customers against the

their king air three sixty promotional material next drawn joins two other major oems to feature of i s n s products has standard equipment on their production aircraft joining collates pc twenty four ums and boeing's kc forty six tanker as major oem contracts of perspectively significant duration and value the contracts offer a growing base of long term recurring revenue as expected for the last years there's supporting texture and looking into opportunities for the thrust tests workload reducing features on their other production platforms they're grateful to see the service center organization that has positively pursued the significant retrofit opera utilities of thousands of king airs currently in service not sequently we are working with textron to ensure our production levels meet the service centers demand for auto trial and help moat the availability of this potentially life-saving technology to king arrows owners threat sets also has a base for expanding beyond the general aviation market to look at the military aircraft and er transports and multi engine aircraft as well in addition we are finding that the public publicity surrounding our threat sets as a created interest with other oems you know potentially likes our potentially life-cycling faa certified one inch and an operative upset protection is a compelling differentiator that multi engine operators are now very interested in they're optimistic to contracts with textron support the wide adoption of a technology that not only improves their performance but can provide unparalleled safety precipitated by hearing our business we have hired a sales and service support representative station in wichita he will support our as a business at textron and explore new business opportunities in the region you're working with textron worldwide service organization supporting autothral retrofits our original program director is essentially addressing addressing a large military opportunities and air transport markets with very encouraging results continue to recruit sales and support person now for our growing business demand and for thrust sets auto throttle and lifeguard protection systems in addition september of twenty twenty we announced the faa had certified our synthetic vision installation and auto throttle upgrade for the eclipse jet the eclipse has the eclipse was the first aircraft in which we developed an auto throttle and we are pleased to be able to offer owners the ability to upgrade the airplanes our latest features the ongoing growth of the undergoing growth of online shopping keeps he used to fuel the increase in the number of seven five seven and six seven aircraft being converted to cargo this has generated increasing demand for a flat panel display technology engineering and develop that were completed we shipped our upgrade for us navy erdated computers for the f five in the fourth quarter right now marketing international customers for the f five let me turn this over to rell for some financial results thank you jeff and thank you all for joining us this morning looking terms at the fourth quarter revenues were six point three million of thirty one percent from four point eight billion a year ago and generated a thirty nine percent increase in operating income this was the best quarterly rate of growth in this fiscal year growth this quarter was almost entirely in product and customer service revenue as we completed final engineering on the us navy f five air data computer development contract and we shipped the entire production order in the quarter gross margins for the quarter were fifty five point eight percent down from fifty nine point five in the number with the decrease attributable to product mix higher warranty and material costs also this quarter we had limited engineering development revenue unlike the year ago quarter which yield yielded strong margins that were the last margins remain in line with the store for average's achieved over the years good walker in these messages for the fourth quarter of fiscal twenty twenty were two point three million up from two million in the year ago quarter this modest increase and expense reflects the additional the additional resources needed to support the companies thirty percent revenue growth rates research and development expenses up over the year ago quarter reflecting a shift to more internally funded or in digging at that the cut some refunded at five development contract is completed r and d was approximately eleven percent of courting revenues which is consistent with our strong commitment to innovative and new product development that one in general and administrative expenses we're up about eight percent from the year ago quarter again primarily due to the need to that resources to support our increased business activity for the quarter we generated operating income of one point two million or approximately nineteen or center revenue other income was down from a year ago quarter as interest rates decrease we reported according to that income of one point two million or seven cents per share look at results for the year until revenues were twenty up point six million of twenty three percent from seventeen point six million for full year twenty nineteen the tuba reported fiscal twenty twenty that income of three point three million over nineteen cents per share increases seventy four were at seventy three percent respectively from that income at one point nine or eleven cents per share for fiscal twenty nineteen the company remains in strong financial position we generated over two point two million of positive cash flow from operations in fiscal twenty twenty of which one point six million was generated in the fourth quarter and had twelve point six million of cash on hand at september thirty twenty twenty the company is debt free in september the quarter directors declared attached dividend in the amount of sixty five cents per share or approximately the other point two million which was paid on october first twenty twenty the dividend appears as as an approval on a september thirty twenty twenty balance sheet offset by a course by mean restricted cash we believe that the company has sufficient cash with fund operations for the foreseeable future now i'd like to turn the call over to show thank you bradline good morning everyone the fourth quarter was the best sales quarter of the fiscal twenty twenty and put a fine point on our second consecutive year of top and bottom line growth and strong cash generation or ultimately it was a year in which europe our third ovm production contract with a tier one manufacturer <unk> three sixty and king gave two sixty our new aircraft that will feature our threats and auto throw at standard equipment during our ongoing ovm contracts with providers and boeing these are we of contracts we are building a solid foundation of recurring revenue that should last three years and also quickly reiterate what just mentioned earlier generated this strong growth and profitability and successfully executed on the kingdom contract while implementing new safety policy and procedures that have kept all of our employees and productive as well as protected or partners and customers you can get three sixty program is just ramping up with the first production aircraft delivered to cuts from the last month it can get two sixty the schedule for delivery in the third half of twenty twenty one we have been shipping frost since you need to text on since third quarter and expect orders to naturally follow the anticipated increase in production over time in addition to shipping units for installation and routine years three sixty there are also shipping units extra so for distribution to the service centers where they have been used for retrofit installations as you mentioned the retrofit opportunity is much greater than the full ward face with about five thousand kings currently in service which we estimate represents about a three hundred million total addressable market at this point we are certified for retrofit the beachcraft can give three hundred series a corporate program fusion avionics and the program twenty one a corps beachcraft can get two hundred series other variations of this is the see are being pursued with some evidence we are consequently also shipping order travels to our installation partners where the peers many can get owners take their aircraft for service both organizations are aggressively marketing the retrofit that you are opening an office in which to not only promote the product but also support texture the relationship with texas is going well and provides a solid foundation from which we expand our overall market only <unk> across can get platforms but other years as well as the military we are in conversation with manufacturers of both twin several problems twin jets and multi engineer aircraft with regards to all of the travel potentially life saving nature of process or multi-engine aircraft is a feature enriched virtually all oems have an interest september twenty twenty you announced that actually had thirty five thousand thirty regional installation and overall operate for the eclipse chair this installation marks ice and it says first operate directly to eclipse owners and involve substantial pre-orders the cliff owners now have the benefit of significant functional upgrades and ongoing part support directly from the partnership with i s and s i will not briefly review some of our ongoing programs pc twenty four program has essentially reached study state production levels the expected ship posts the fifty ship sets in physical twenty twenty one to support their current production rate this program remains highly successful allows is very satisfied with our performance this program we believe is expected to continue to run for many years offering it predictable stable the care and revenue stream dynamics in the commercial transcript market are also essentially on change their congo delivery services continue to convert four in seven five seven and seven six seven planes including upgrades to our flat panel displays every once contractors with large installers you are not doing more than rec sells to carriers which has proven much more successful it remains over a thousand operational seven five and seven six seven that are still in need of retrofitting and even larger number of seven three sevens here to be update development work for the us navy five a data computer was completed and we delivered production units for the us navy fleet but profit in the fourth quarter this was a highly successful program and we are now turning our attention to foreign military which also fly the f five and would be a large new market for this versatile product at eighty forty six program the boeing is one of our three oem production contracts it continues to make steady contribution to our recurring revenue and profitability you ordered in the fourth quarter of fiscal twenty twenty for over three point four million and backlog as of september thirty twenty twenty was three point six bookings for full year during excess of nineteen million keep in mind the backlog at the end of any one quarter is not necessarily indicative of future business activity as the general it's a good portion of our revenue from customer service and interpreter booking ship all this the ongoing pandemic has had peripheral effect on our center marketing activity limiting our ability to personally meet with customers and prospects but in some complexity working with the faa which is operating on the work from home directives balance do not believe the pandemic has or will have a significant impact on our business and are excited about the prospects of our portfolio of our products let me turn the call back to jeff for some closing remarks thanks sharon the only success of our auto throttles strongly suggest that this strategy is creating real value for both our customers and for our stockholders we're entering a new fiscal year year with momentum for two years of strong growth solid balance sheet and a portfolio of products that are receiving enthusiastic market reception you see a great opportunity thank you for your ongoing support and encouragement thank you to the audience today i'll take questions that's required thank you we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your telephone keypad if you're using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press start then to at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster and the first question will come from david campbell with thompson david please go ahead good morning hey good morning jeff <unk> and <unk> thanks for having us as a good quarter uh i just wanted to ask you uh well about what do you assume what i should assume for a crude tax rate uh in fiscal twenty one i would say will it will it be will it begin to be a tax rules yeah will be some expense but it'll be a lesson because we still have some nls and some r and d tax credits so i would use a estimated use like a five percent effective tax rate type of thing okay so thanks and uh jeff and uh uh serum uh were any of the uh shipments to uh the king years were any of them were were were m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m m well a lot of a lot of o m actually twenty o m the shipments obviously the airplanes haven't come both the line yet but um and then and then uh a very a very rapidly growing to band had retrofit but no retrofit then revenue's head oh well yeah we didn't know we actually texted did i installation in australia on a retrofit uh on uh using our uh oracle for that uh a number of them we've had you know their local service centers they have a huge network of service centers throughout the world and uh the the very encouraging thing is they are very aggressively uh um promoting the the uh auto front so it's it's it's it's it looks better almost every day it's very good so you'll expect that to be uh you expect those revenues to increase and so so twenty one very much so we believe that the growth is gonna be exponential right right the usual this quarter this december quarter will have the usual seasonal downturn is that correct thank you yeah maybe we'll do a little better yeah okay well thanks for anything the questions i we're trying to do we're trying to do better we're trying to keep from both stable and straight um look we've had the operation is good it generates cash every every day virtually it's excellent um was profitable and as our volume goes up it becomes more for not only because he covers all the fixed overheads a lot of which affects the president profitability so we're very optimistic about the future we're very pleased about textron's interest in support in our products and um and see a large retrofit opportunity listen we're already we're delivering five seven six seven systems to another um uh a very new um demand for uh um for um uh average carry yourself i mean it's uh it's uh business is coming up and when you consider the the the other effects of pandemic but what did most of aerospace companies haven't struggling we've done really well well you're doing you're doing a great job thanks for your help if i'm doing what i well i'm hoping to do this coming here and it'll start looking a lot better um i think we're fortunate we have a very good product that is very producible we've got a great customer um all of our customers are outstanding um we're very fortunate with that so um we just keep working at it you know every day get up and and uh as that marie's they kick ass to take games well thanks so much for answering the question i gotta get off the call i appreciate all the work good job thank you thank you once again if you have a question please press star then one the next question is from roger goal a private investor please go ahead good morning well first of all thanks for a great quarter and a great year um validates my late father's trust in you as you know um and my sister and i are my i also wanna acknowledge the fact that uh the last quarter in the last year of history but it sounds like you guys have set the company up for fabulous growth in the future that without being colleague and it could make the past look like uh small potatoes so congratulations on that um my question as it usually is goes to the use of cash we've got a company with no debt with solid operating profit uh um and and even after the dividend a fair amount of cash on the books uh any thoughts of either uh an acquisition or a small regular cash dividend that i think would have a great empty act on the slack pressure um it's a good question um some of that i can answer some of us you can i know you can't i know you can't but it's a reasonable question absolutely uh look we have we know we generate a lot of cash and our interest is robbery in the business not not for us to look at cash that doesn't generate any income at all i mean i personally have cash accounts that they're they're paying interest in pennies so um yeah yeah yeah so we don't know interest in doing that anymore um if we can reasonably invest in in other things we're doing some some uh automation on the floor and and and tapping kind of things um great we are actually looking at dividends on a long term basis because we believe that the business itself will generate cash on a regular basis and that we believe that that our stockholders can make of use of the of cash so we're conscious we're very conscious of that um that's that's what precipitated the sixty five cent uh yeah and yes we continue to look at it especially like what might be changes yeah that's all that's all i can ask for and again well done you guys are doing a great job of positioning this company for the future with your dad he was always fun he's a good guy well thank you we miss him too we miss him too but uh i i'm hoping after covid just to come on out there and meet you guys and spend some time so um look forward to it i know okay thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question and answer session i would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks thank you uh appears that uh our management line is inadvertently disconnected so uh we thank you everyone for joining today's presentation uh the call has been completed and you may now disconnect okay
