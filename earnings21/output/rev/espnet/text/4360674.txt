call based on current expectations and assumptions which are subject to risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materialally from our forward looking statements if any of our key assumptions are incorrect or because of other factors discussed in today's earnings usually in the comments made during this conference call in the risk factors section of the company presentation on our latest reports and filings with the security and exchange commission each of which can make that on our website next our energy dot com and next our energy partners dot com we do not undertake any duty to update any forward looking statements today's presentation also includes references to non-cap financial measures you should refer to the information contained in the slides the company to age presentation for definitional information and reconciliations of historical non gap measures to the closest gap financial measure with that i will turn the call over to rebecca thank you matt and good morning everyone next our energy delivered strong side concorder results and continue to perform well both financially and operationally while managing the ongoing impacts of the covid nineteen pandemic as part of our core goal of safely delivering affordable and reliable power to our customers we continue to operate under our endemic plan that we activated last quarter despite the challenges created by the pandemic next to our energies second quarter adjusted earnings per share increased by more than eleven percent versus the prior year comparable quarter and we are well positioned to meet our overall actives for the year fpl increased earnings per share by fifteen cents year over year and its strong execution continues across the board during the quarter fpl set a new system peak load of more than twenty four thousand five hundred megawatts fp transmission and distribution systems continue to operate in line with our high reliability standards and our highly efficient gas generating facilities remain available to serve our customers appeals continued strong execution is a result of the smart capital investment that we have made over the past several decades to enhance our customer value proposition of low bills high reliability outstanding customer service and clean energy solutions consistent with enhancing it's best in class customer a proposition last month fpl announced plans to retire a sheriff for it's last remaining coal unit together with our joint interest owner j e a and subject to certain approvals from the florida public service commission fpl intends to retire the eight hundred forty s megawatt coal fire plant in early twenty twenty two the retirement of share four is projected to generate hundreds of millions of dollars in savings for fpl customers and prevent roughly four million tons of carbon dioxide emissions annually from this unit sheriff's retirement is the final step of the coal phase out strategy that fpl launched in twenty fifteen and that will complete the complete closure of approximately two thousand seven hundred megawatts of coal capacity including the highest greenhouse in the in gas power power plants in florida these transactions which will make fpl one of the first utilities to eliminate all of the coal from a generation portfolio demonstrate fpl's continued commitment and position as a clean energy leader we remain proud of our environmental track record particularly the co2 emissions reductions that we have delivered throughout florida and across the country and we continue to remain focused on building a sustainable energy era that is both clean and affordable gulf power also had a strong quarter of execution the focus on operational cost effectiveness at gulf continues to progress well with year to date o and m cost excluding specific covid nineteen related expenses that declining by nearly ten percent versus the prior year comfortable period and by approximately twenty five percent relative to twenty eighteen gulf power also delivered further improvements and service reliability and continued its significant improvement in employee safely safety with no to recordables year to date to the end of june we remain committed to delivering on the objectives that we've previously outlined the gulf power and continue to expect to generate significant customer and shareholder value over the coming years during the quarter we completed our annual storm bills for pl and gulf power to prepare for the unprecedented situation of restoring power after a hurricane in the midst of the covid nineteen pandemic we spent two weeks drilling and challenging our teams to find ways to efficiently restore service to our customers without sacrificing safety the drills provided a number of lessons including how to leverage technology to quickly and safely screen personnel at various staging sites to help offset some of the challenges that will inevitably occur when performing storm restoration in the midst of a pandemic while we hope that our service territories will avoid the impacts of hurricanes this year consistent with our culture that is focused on preparedness and execution we continue to do everything we can to ensure that we will be there for our customers when they need us most at energy resources adjusted dps increased by thirteen cents every year the energy resources team continue to capitalize on the terrific market opportunity for low cost renewables adding one thousand seven hundred thirty megawatts to our backlog since the last earnings call this continued origination success through the ongoing pandemic is a test testament to the energy resources significant competitive advantages including our best in class renewables development skills our engineering construction team also continues to execute commissioning roughly six hundred fifty megawatts during the quarter and keeping the remaining approximately four thousand four hundred megawatts of wind and solar projects that we expect to complete this year on track despite the significant supply chain challenges that are occurring both globally and locally well we are monitoring the situation closely we continue to expect that all of our planned twenty twenty renewables projects will achieve their in service dates this year in response to increased investor focus on environmental social and governance issues or esg next week we expect to publish next our energies updated esg report which includes reporting under the sustainability accounting standards board or sasb disclosures our company has been focused on all of the elements of esg for more than twenty five years extra energies approach to governance and risk oversight combined with the way that we treat our our people our customers our communities and the environment our proof that a company can be both sustainable and financially successful at the same time the new report highlights this alignment of our corporate strategy with the key tenants and dsg includes a robust discussion of risk oversight and incorporates new disclosures such as diversity and inclusion metrics diversity and inclusion matter deeply to us as a company both because we believe they're the right thing to do but all because diverse and inclusive teams deliver better business results for the diverse communities that we serve our commitment to having a diverse workforce and inclusive culture is not new and our diversity metrics are better than many of the companies in our industry however consistent with our focus on continuous improvement we are not satisfied and we'll continue our efforts to build an even more diverse and inclusive team going forward overall we'll please with progress we've made an extra energy so far in twenty twenty headed into the second half of the year we believe we are well positioned to achieve the full year expectations that we have previously discussed even when accounting for a reasonable range of impacts and outcomes that may result from the current pandemic that was turned a detailed results beginning with fpl for the second quarter of twenty twenty fpl reported net income of seven hundred forty nine million or a dollar fifty two per share which is an increase of eighty six million and fifteen cents per share respectively year over year regulatory capital employed increased by more than ten percent over the same quarter last year and was a principal driver of fpl's net income growth of approximately thirteen percent fpl's capital expenditures were approximately one point eight million dollars in the second quarter and we now expect our four year capital investments to total between six point five billion and six point seven billion a reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately eleven point six percent for the twelve months ended june twenty twenty which is at the upper end of the allowed band of nine point six to eleven point six percent allowed under our current rate agreement during the quarter we utilized seven million dollars of reserve amorization to achieve of our target regulatory roe leading fpo with a balance of seven hundred thirty six million we continue to expect that fpl will end twenty twenty with a sufficient amount of surplus to continue operating under the current base rate set of an agreement during twenty twenty one as we previously discussed we expect that fpl and goal will operate as a single larger florida utility company which will create both operational and financial benefits for our customers as a result in may the company's filed an application with <unk> for an approval of an internal reorganization whereby gulf would merge into fpl subject to approval the companies will merge in january of twenty twenty one however during the twenty twenty one gulf power will continue to operate as a separate operating division serving its existing customers under separate retail rates we continue to expect the companies to file a combined rate case in the first quarter of next year for new rates effective in january twenty twenty two turning to our development efforts all of our major capital initiatives at fpl remain on track and on budget during the quarter the final three hundred megawatts of solar being built under the solar based rate adjustment or sober mechanism of that field base rate settlement agreement were placed into service the twelve hundred megawatts of cost effective solar constructed under the sober mechanism are expected to generate significant customer benefits and represent the early stages of fpl's rapid solar expansion and the next phase of its generation modernization efforts the next six solar together projects totally approximately four hundred fifty megawatts remain on track to be placed in service later this year the final six hundred megawatts of the roughly fifteen hundred megawatt community solar program are expected to be placed in service next year beyond solar construction on the highly efficient roughly twelve hundred megawatt daniel beach clean energy center remains on schedule and on budget as it continues to advance towards its projected commercial operation date in twenty twenty two additionally the four hundred nine megawatt manatee storage facility which will be one of the world's largest battery storage plants is on track and on budget to be complete next year based on her ongoing analysis of the long term potential of low cost renewables remain confident desire that wind solar and battery storage will be hugely disruptive to the energy's existing generation the country's existing generation while reducing costs for customers and helping to achieve future co2 emissions reductions however to achieve an emissions free future we believe that other technologies will be necessary and we are particularly excited about the long term potential of hydrogen consistent with a toe in the water approach we've previously utilized with solar and battery storage we are planning to propose a hydrogen pilot project at fpl is approximately sixty five million dollar pilot project which subject to florida public service commission approval is expected to be in service in twenty twenty three will utilize solar energy that would have otherwise been clipped to produce a hundred percent green hydrogen through a roughly twenty megawatt electrolysis system the hydrogen will be used to replace a portion of the natural gas that is consumed by one of the three gas turbines that the <unk> clean energy center we believe that the project is a compliment to our ongoing solar and battery storage development efforts and highlights fpls continued innovative approach to further enhance the diversity of the clean energy solutions available for its customers we continue to evaluate other potential hydrogen opportunities across our businesses and while our your term investments are expected to be small in context of our overall capital program we are excited about the technologies longterm potential which should further support future demand for low cost renewables as well as accelerate the decarbonization of transportation fuel and industrial feed stocks we continue to expect that fpl's ongoing smart investment opportunities will support a compound annual growth rate in the regulatory capital employed of approximately nine percent from twenty eighteen through twenty twenty two while further enhancing our best in class customer value proposition let me now turn to gulf power which reported second quarter twenty twenty gap earnings of fifty five million or eleven cents per share a decline of one cent per share relative to gulf powers adjusted earnings per share in the prior year period this quarter results include the impact of roughly five million of after tax covid nineteen related expenses primarily reflecting the expected incremental by a debt expense as a result of the pandemic earlier this month the florida public service commission approved gulf powers request to record costs attributable to covid nineteen including bad debt expense as a regulatory asset on this balance sheet the as a result the cost recorder during the second quarter are expected to be reversed during the third quarter as the regulatory asset is recorded both powers reported roe for regulatory purposes will be approximately ten point four percent for the twelve months ending june twenty twenty for the full year twenty twenty we are targeting a regulatory roe in the upper half of the allowed band of nine point two five percent to eleven point two five percent during the quarter gulf powers capital expenditures we're roughly a hundred seventy million and we now expect our full year capital investments to total between one point zero and one point one billion dollars all of gulf major smart capital investments including the north florida resiliency connection and the plant christ cold and natural gas conversion continue to progress well similar to other parts of the country the florida economy is being impacted by the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic recent economic data reflects an increase in florida unemployment rate and a decline in consumer confidence that are roughly in line with the changes the national averages of each metric while it is still unclear at this point how severely the economy will ultimately be impacted we continue to believe that the financial strengths and structural advantages with which florida entered the crisis and they continue to traction of the state to both new residents and residents and new businesses will support a rebound once the worst of the pandemic is behind us we remain deep lead engaged in helping florida return from this stronger than ever we will continue to do our part to support that outcome including pursuing our smart capital investment program and economic development efforts which help create jobs provide investment in local communities and further enhance our best in class customer value proposition during the quarter fields average number of customers continue this recent trend of strong underlying growth increasing by approximately seventy five thousand from the comparable prior your quarter field second quarter retail sales decreased by point eight percent year over year as customer growth and favorable weather we're more than offset by a decline in underlying usage per customer based on our analysis the overall effect of the pandemic on underlying usage during the second quarter were relatively muted field benefits from having as retail sales being heavily weighted towards residential customers and approximately forty percent of its load is cooling related and therefore important for go comfort and building maintenance during april when stay at home orders were broadly in effect fpl's weather normalized retail sales were down approximately four percent relative to our expectations as the economy began reopening in early may weather no lives retail sales improved and we're above our expectations in june while the ultimate impacts of the pandemic on underlying usage remain unknown at this time we continue to expect the flexibility provided by a reserve amorization mechanism to offset any fluctuation retail sales or bad debt expense and support regulatory roe at the upper end of the loud band of nine point six percent to eleven point six percent under our current rate agreement for gold power the average number of customers increased a per actually one point three percent versus the comparable prior year quarter both power second quarter retail sales declined by roughly six point two percent year over year as a result of the under of the unfavorable weather comparison and a decline in underlying usage for customers over the second quarter gulf power experience a more significant decline than underlying usage for customers than fpl but also experienced an improvement as the economy began reopening in may and june as a reminder unlike fpl gulf power does not have a reserve amorization mechanism under its settlement agreement to offset fluctuations in revenue or costs to any variability would therefore have more impact to gulf's earnings in roe than at fpl as a reminder as we've often just gust whether normalization is in precise particularly when evaluating short periods of time additional details on retail sales at fpl and gulf power are included in the appendix of today's presentation let me now turn to energy resources which reported second quarter twenty twenty gap earnings of four hundred eighty one million or ninety seven cents per share and adjusted earnings of five hundred thirty one million or a dollar oh eight per share this is an increase in adjusted earnings per share of thirteen cents are approximately fourteen percent from last year's comparable quarter results which have been restated to reflect the results of our next our energy transmission business formally reported in corporate another new investments added eight cents per share contribution from existing generation assets increased five cents per share as improved wind resource and increased ptc volume from our repair wind projects were partially offset by the refueling outage at the seabrook nuclear facility second quarter fleet wide wind resource was ninety nine percent of the long-term average versus ninety three percent or in the second quarter of twenty nineteen also contributing favorably with next mg transmission where contributions increased by three cents versus twenty nineteen con solutions from our gas infrastructure business including existing pipelines were flat year over year these favorable contributions were partially offset by lower contributions from our customer supply and trading business which declined four cents versus the particularly strong second quarter last year all other impacts increased results by one cent per share as i mentioned earlier mg resources development team had another excellent quarter of origination success adding one thousand seven hundred and thirty megawatts to our backlog since our last earnings call we have added seven hundred eight megawatts of wind eight hundred forty four megawatts of solar and a hundred seventy eight megawatts of battery storage to our renewables backlog we also executed a build own transfer for a two hundred megawatt solar project which is not included in our backlog additions all of the battery storage projects will be paired with either new or existing solar projects to take advantage of the itc and provide a more firm renewable product for our customers the continued strong demand for battery storage projects highlights the rapid transition to the next phase of renewables development that pairs low cost wind and solar energy with a low cost battery storage solution we continue to expect that by the middle of this decade without incentives new near firm wind and new near firm solar will be cheaper than the operating costs of most existing coal and nuclear facilities and less fuel efficient oil and gas fire generation units producing significant long term renewables demand our current backlog now totals approximately fourteen thousand four hundred megawatts and is the largest we have ever had in our roughly twenty year development has three to put our backlog into context it is larger than the current operating in wind solar portfolios of all but two other companies in the world as of year end twenty nineteen highlighting the next energy continues to be at forefront of disruption that is occurring within the energy sector only halfway through twenty twenty we are pleased to have already signed nearly thirty five hundred megas of contracts for delivery beyond twenty twenty two which is a reflection of the continued strong economic demand for wind solar and battery storage to ensure that we can take advantage of this significant demand in the coming years we now have more than two billion dollars of safe harbor wind and solar equipment which could have for as much as forty billion of wind solar and battery storage investments across all of our businesses from twenty twenty one to twenty twenty four these purchases highlight the benefits of scale and the strength of our balance sheet that we average as a key competitive advantage in renewables development and position as well for continued long-term growth the safe harbor equipment also supports additional repowering opportunities including several hundred megawatts of potential twenty twenty one powering projects which we are currently evaluating as i discussed earlier all of the twenty twenty renewables projects remain on track to achieve their targeted in service states this year as a result we do not expect these projects to rely on the up treasury start of construction guidance that was released during the quarter beyond renewables we continue to make progress with mountain valley pipeline and work with our project partners to resolve the outstanding permit issues required for the pipelines construction we were pleased with the supreme court's ruling regarding appalachian trail crossing authorization authority which resolved similar issues for mvp we were similarly pleased that the supreme court partially stayed the montana federal court's decision related to the na m y twelve permit program and are working with the army corps of engineers on this re-issuance of the projects permit following comprehensive re-study by the relevant agencies we expect issuance of mvps revised biological opinion shortly assuming timely resolution of the outstanding permitting issues we are now targeting a full in service date for the pipeline during early twenty twenty one and expect an overall project estimate in the range of five point four to five point seven billion turning now to the consolidated results for next year energy for the second quarter of twenty twenty gap net income attributable to next year energy was one point two seven by five billion or two dollars and fifty nine cents per share next year energies twenty twenty and quarter adjusted earnings and adjusted dps for one point two eight six billion and two dollars and sixty one cents per share respectively adjusted earnings from corporate corporate another declined by one set year over year primarily as a result of how your interest expense next our energy also delivered strong year to date operating cash flow growth and for the full year twenty twenty expects to generate roughly eight point five billion in operating cash flow to help support its strong financial position next energy maintains approximately thirteen billion dollars in liquidity this is to support the largest capital investment program in our history since last quarters call we completed roughly three billion in long-term financings it includes at two point two billion in capital holdings defentures over the course of the last few months we repaid nearly all of the term loans that we issued during march and april and converted these commitments to bilateral revolving credit facilities included in these facilities is a total of more than one billion in six month storm facilities at fpl and gulf power which similar to previous years we put in place to ensure sufficient liquidity in the event of a hurricane energy resources also closed to tax equity financings including its first ever combined wind and solar portfolio financing and we expect to close on the balance of our tax equity financings as the renewable projects are placed in service later this year our year to date financing activities our evidence of the great financial partnerships we have built over time which help provide ample liquidity and continued access to capital to support our outstanding growth prospects extra energies financial expectations remain unchanged we continue to expect that next year energies adjusted eps compound annual growth rate to be in a range of six percent to eight percent through twenty twenty one off of the twenty eighteen just eps of seven dollars and seventy cents plus the accretion of fifteen cents and twenty cents in twenty twenty and twenty twenty one respectively from the florida acquisitions for twenty twenty we continue to expect our adjusted dps to be in the range of eight dollars and seventy seven to nine dollars and twenty cents for twenty twenty two we expect to grow adjusted dps in the range of sixty eight percent off of the twenty twenty one adjusted dps translating to a range of ten dollars to ten dollars and seventy i sense per share from twenty eighteen to twenty twenty two we continue to expect that operating cash flow will grow roughly in line with our adjusted eps compound annual growth rate range we also continue to expect to grow our evidence for share at roughly ten percent per year through at least twenty twenty two off of a twenty twenty base while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with the expectations that we have outlined in summary the site the challenges created by the covid nineteen pandemic all of our businesses continue to perform well and maintain their excellent prospects for growth going forward we have a longterm track record of delivering results for our customers and shareholders and we remain intensely focused on continuing that track record based on the resiliency of our underlying businesses and their strong growth prospects we will be disappointed if we are not able to deliver financial results at or near the top end of our adjusted earnings per share expectation ranges in twenty twenty twenty twenty one and twenty twenty two while at the same time maintaining our strong credit metrics we continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and believe that next year energy is well positioned to drive long term shareholder value over the coming years let me now turn to next energy partners which continued its strong start to twenty twenty with growth growth and adjusted ebita and cash available for distribution of approximately twenty three percent and forty six percent respectively from the prior year comparable quarter on a year to date basis adjusted ebita and cash available or distribution have increased by twenty six percent and eighty six percent respectively versus twenty nineteen the strong operational financial performance that next energy highlights the next energy partner remains well positioned to continue to deliver on it's outstanding growth for objectives yesterday the next energy partners board declared a quarterly distribution of fifty seven point seven five cents for common unit or two dollars and thirty one for common unit on an annualized basis continue in our track record of growing distributions at the top end of our twelve to fifteen percent per year growth range we were pleased to see pg and e emergence from bankruptcy earlier this month as expected all of our existing contracts were assumed without modification following pg e emergence from bankruptcy next energy partners received a cash distribution of approximately sixty five million from our desert sunlight two fifty and three hundred projects which represent current distributions and those pre obviously withheld as a result of the bankruptcy the release of the desert sunlight trap cash supplements and extra energy partners liquidity which was approximately six hundred and fifty million including cash on hand at the end of the second quarter the organic with investments at next energy partners continue to progress well the approximately two hundred seventy five megawatts of wind repowering and the texas pipelines expansion both remain on track to be in service later this year we continue to expect to execute on it additional attractive growth opportunities as next energy partners portfolio further expands let me now review the detailed results for next energy partners second quarter adjusted ebita with three hundred forty nine million and cash available for distribution was a hundred and sixty six million dollars up twenty three percent and forty six percent respectively against the prior year comparable quarter now that the pg e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved and distributions from our desert sunlight projects have resumed cash available for distribution includes all contributions from pg e related projects new projects added fifty one million dollars in adjusted ebita and thirty six million dollars of cash available for distribution existing projects also contributed to to the significant year of your growth in adjusted ebita and cash available for distribution as resource was favorable across the portfolio for the second quarter when resource was a hundred percent of a long-term average versus ninety four percent in the prior year comparable quarter cash available for distribution also benefited from a reduction in project level debt service primarily as a result of the early debt retirement to facilitate the wind repairings the reduction in project level debt service was partially offset by higher corporate level interest expense as a reminder these results are net of idr fees since we treat these as operating expense additional details are shown on the accompanying slide let me now turn to next energy partners expectations which remain and changed next energy partners continues to expect december thirty first twenty twenty run rate for adjusted ebita to be a range of one point two two five billion to one point four billion and cash available for distribution in the range of five hundred sixty million to six hundred forty million reflecting calendar year twenty twenty one expectations for the portfolio at the end of twenty twenty now that the pg e bankruptcy has been favorably resolved we will no longer provide cathy expectations including contribution excluding the contributions from the desert semi projects as a reminder these expectations include the impact of anticipated idr fees as we treat these as an operating expense from the base of our fourth quarter twenty nineteen distribution for common unit at an annualized rate of two dollars and fourteen cents we continue to see twelve to fifteen percent growth per year in lp distributions as being a reasonable range of expectations through at least twenty twenty four we expect the annualized rate of the fourth quarter twenty twenty distribution that is payable in february of twenty twenty one to be in a range of two dollars and forty cents to two dollars and forty six cents per common unit similar to extra energy while our expectations always assume normal weather and operating conditions as we consider a reasonable range of impacts related to the current pandemic we continue to feel comfortable with our overall expectations with resumption of cash distributions from the desert sunlight projects we now expect to achieve next energy partners twenty two twenty distribution growth objectives while maintaining a trailing twelve month payout ratio of approximately seventy percent highlighting the significant flexibility we believe next journey partners has going forward as we've previously discussed we will continue to be opportunistic externity partners favorable positioning should give it flexibility to achieve its long-term distribution growth objectives without the need to make any acquisitions until twenty twenty two we are pleased with next to energy partners year to date performance in twenty twenty and believe it continues to offer a best in class value proposition for investors the diversity and longterm contracted nature of next energy partners clean energy portfolio helps insulate it from the broader eco on the conditions including impacts related to the covid nineteen pandemic with a flexibility to grow in three ways acquiring assets from energy resources organically or acquiring assets from third parties next energy partners has clear visibility in to its growth going forward following another strong quarter of origination energy resources portfolio of renewable projects now totals more than twenty seven gigawatts including the signed backlog of projects that energy resources plans to build in the coming years when combined with the prospects for future renewables development next strategy partners long-term growth visibility remains as strong as ever next strategy partners cost of capital and access to capital advantages to including significant demand from various low cost private infrastructure capital provide flexibility to finance this growth over the longterm these strengths together with next energy partners favorable tax position and enhanced governance rights leave next energy partners uniquely positioned to continue to deliver on its objectives going forward in closing we believe that the fundamental value proposition of nextdoor energy and nextdoor energy partners remains as robust as a both companies remain resilient and well positioned to deliver on their commitments they continue to remain enthusiastic about our future and are continued and are focused on delivering smart capital investments that enhance value for the customers and shareholders and expand our position as the world's leading clean energy provider that concludes our prepared remarks and with that we'll open up the line for questions ladies and gentlemen at this time if you would like to ask a question please press star and then one using a touchdown telephone to withdraw your questions you may press star and two if you are using a speaker phone we do ask that you please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers to ensure that the sound quality but again that is star and then one to ask a question we'll pause momentarily to assemble the roster in our first question today comes from julian smith from bank of america please go ahead with your question hey good morning this is uh actually richie here for julian um just had a question around the the capex raised at fpl and uh gold what what was driving that is that more around um undergrounding grid hardening or is that more on the solar side and how should we think about the capex trajectory from twenty one and beyond is that more in line with what you disclose at your analyst day or should we expect it to be more of these robust robust levels going forward richie um good morning and thanks for the question um i think it really reflects uh a you know consistency with what we've been talking about for a long time which is we keep finding terrific projects uh for our customers and investment opportunities um and we're we're starting to put those in place um as i highlighted in the prepared remarks um we do have a consistent expectations for the growth rate uh between twenty eighteen and twenty twenty two of a nine percent compound annual growth rate um so obviously some projects moved from one year to another um but at the at the heart of it it is terrific investments for the benefit of our customers um as far as beyond what twenty two um you know similar to comments that we've made in the past the growth opportunities that we see across all of our businesses but specific at fpl and gulf power um include the modernization efforts um including the large deployment of solar over time um as well as investments in grid hardening um and undergrounding is highlighted by the storm protection plan uh that we're in the process of uh of going through approvals and and um and you know initial investments uh for that program so we're super excited about the opportunities for investing and again they're very focused on ensuring uh that these are good projects for the benefit of our customers got it thanks that's very helpful and then just um around your comments around hydrogen i think disclose uh sixty five million for that pilot project um what what are you seeing there on that front is this more around uh transportation opportunities or is this um all around like uh type of and being able to like blend with uh pipes um so we're really excited about hydrogen in in particular when we think about getting to a um not a net zero um emissions uh profile but actually a zero carbon emissions profile and for when you know when we looked at this let's call it five ten years ago um and we thought about what it would take to get to true uh zero emissions we were worried that it was extraordinarily expensive uh for customers what makes us really excited about hydrogen particularly in the twenty thirty and beyond timeframe is that that has the potential to supplement significant deployment of renewables including wind and solar technologies complemented by short and i'll call it medium term duration batteries um but then that last amount of emissions um that that you would take out of the system to get down to zero it could be most economically served by hydrogen um so that's what makes us excited about doing a pilot project we're very excited about the opportunity to present that to the florida public service commission um as a way to you know further enhance um fpl's ability to innovate and deliver these long term um you know clean energy solutions to our customers um and as part of that we'll learn about the technologies and we'll see what other opportunities there are uh potentially for the industrial and transportation sectors um you know and and for us to be able to you know produce that uh the green and g to produce the green hydrogen uh is a potential significant opportunity for us we think we're at the early stages um which is you know kind of consistent with our toe in the water approach we wanna get some experience with it obviously do a lot of research um and uh to folks in the in the supply chain and get better equipped to deal uh you know take advantage of these opportunities uh but we're really excited about it all right thanks a lot that's all the questions i had thank you our next question comes from <unk> from guggenheim partners please go ahead with your question hi good morning it's actually conferencing here for char as well um congratulations on a great quarter it's a we've definitely seen some impressive numbers for the backlog editions and kind of contract increases for the twenty two timeframe just kind of curious on kind of your thoughts around kind of near growth trajectory and kind of contribution to the business a mix and i i it's kind of subsided as a conversation point from the rating agencies but just thoughts on kind of growing contributions from near kind of versus balancing that from the regulated contributions you know it doesn't are you thinking about both on activists or kind of any kind of drop downs accelerated from here just some thoughts around that uh thanks company we appreciate uh appreciate you dialing in this morning um we're really excited about pursuing opportunities for investment um across the board and of course at fpl and golf that's focused on investments that that you know need the need to create value for our customers and our energy resources it's return focused along with you know delivering things for our customers there to so from a corporate perspective we don't wanna limit any of our businesses um when we find great investment opportunities which you know again i can't highlight enough about how excited we are about the renewables development prospects at at energy resources so we're not gonna constrain them in any way you know we will develop those opportunities that create value for shareholders and to the extent that we wanna maintain balance over time we've got a lot of opportunities to do that that are created for shareholders um including recycling of capital through next energy partners uh which is obviously a a willing and excited aquirer of energy resources projects um but energy resources has the ability to recycle capital to to third parties as well uh so there's plenty of ways to ensure that we can uh create the real you know value of creative opportunities um and still think about it from a corporate perspective in a variety of different ways thanks that's uh that that's very helpful and uh kind of pivoting a little bit to to something a little bit longer term i guess to we get some of your thoughts on the november election and kind of the biden campaign has put out some plans and frameworks out there higher tax rate clean energy support uh how is next their position for kind of potential changes at the federal level so so this is jim uh you know we we always position our business to try to win regardless of the outcome of elections and and so you know we uh i think you can remember back uh three you know close to four years ago now there was some turmoil around our stock uh when president trump was elected uh we've uh managed completely fine under this administration in terms of being able to continue to grow our renewable business because you know what it's all about economics right and and and the time for renewables is now and you know that that on a transcends politics frankly the economics and the and the need to you know and the and and really the the need to decarbonize uh not only the electric sector but the rest of the sectors of the economy are really you know really frank we transcend what happens in elections and so uh you know obviously we watch some closely we think uh good clean energy policies important in the right policy for for for america in the future and and uh you know when uh continue i think to be positioned really well regardless of who wins uh in november okay that makes sense i'll uh i'll jump back in the queue thanks so much you our next question comes from michael winestein from credit swiss please go ahead with your question hi good morning guys hey um on the same question uh jim are you what do you think is the most likely outcome from the congress uh these days tax credit extensions cash grants um do you think a national renewable portfolio standard is a possibility uh you know i'm just wondering of all those different alternatives what do you think might actually occur uh yeah in the next four years you know so i think it's honestly uh too soon to tell michael i think um you know what is gonna depend on uh what happens in the election and is there continued split government or is there not split government uh that'll be i think a big driver of what policies happen and uh you know i think uh all of those ideas were on the table we we've been consistent in and and and what we said which is that uh uh you know we think it's important to have uh you know good and fair clean energy policy going forward um we also have said that it's uh that we think wind and and renewables with batteries will be uh you know are very competitive uh you know once the ptcs and the itcs phase out in terms of uh competing against conventional uh generation it's just honestly uh really more a matter of the speed with which you want to decarbonize is what is gonna ultimately drive the final uh i think policy choices and so uh you know we are uh you know obviously we're active engaged in in the discussions and uh uh i think it's premature really to say what we think uh is gonna happen because i think you have an election in four or five months and as you all know elections have consequences and uh and you know we'll we'll see what happens post the election in terms of what's gonna be uh uh the policy landscape going forward great hey i'm on hydrogen uh do you think and i noticed there's a lot of a lot more f to some renewables red and gas turbines and your future construction plants at field and i'm just wondering if uh if hydrogen works out uh is that a method do you think you could actually build more uh put more gas turbines back into the plan and if hydrogen production becomes a viable economic alternative um or do you think other alternative technologies are better suited such as fuel cells mike i think um you know from a hydrogen perspective uh and specific to to flow to parent light company we're talking about potential hydrogen opportunities really in the twenty thirty and beyond timeframe um and in that intervening time we deploy a significant amount of solar technology and then if we're right and if the cost come down for us hydrogen and it is the best alternative for supporting getting to a zero emissions uh profile uh we would um retrofit certain of our you know gas facilities to run on hydrogen or run on a portion of hydrogen uh so i think for florida power and light and gulf power um you know it's at this point and again we're talking about a long way into the future um you wouldn't necessarily need to build any new um you know hydrogen slash gas turbines in that in that port cause we've got a tremendously efficient uh fleet that's already in service um and the investments we would make were really around conversion now whether or not that's true elsewhere in the country i think is um you know it might be a little bit different um but we're talking about a long way down road and a lot of things need to come together to have those types of conversations i think it's it's fairly preliminary gotcha and uh you know one final question uh just make your comment on m and a interest these days what's going on with santi cooper et cetera uh so i think uh we uh this won't be surprising we remain interested in m and a uh we think there's a lot that we can bring to the table we you know i continue to believe that there's not a utility in the country that we couldn't run uh more efficiently and uh uh better for customers and i i truly believe that and uh and so you know we continue to look i think in uh in terms of sandy cooper uh you know that process has been pushed to next year and we remain you know we remain very interested and uh and continue to be focused on uh trying to make that happen uh hey jim what regions of the country are you focused on just curious we we continue to be focused on the the midwest in the southeast gotcha all right thank you very much plus for regulated assets pretty much anywhere okay thanks a lot thank you our next question comes from steven bird from morgan stanley please go ahead with your question hi thanks to steve our carroll on for steven uh thanks for taking my question i had one quick followup just on the hydrogen topic wondering if you see a potential path for this to be an opportunity at near um and also in terms of kind of business model um but do you think that you would envision being involved in owning the electrolysis function uh within the supply chain um and if so you have kind of a vision or a view on uh what technology is ahead of others at this point thanks dave um yeah i would say at this at this point we're looking for opportunity is across the portfolio um obviously we talked about the pilot project fpl to day um but we are looking at other pilot um type investment opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio uh consistent with the way that we approach solar early on and of course batteries um more recently um so i think there will be opportunities over time uh for those type of of pilot projects you know again where you think of it's actually being close to economic today are areas where there's already significant penetration of renewables um because as you well know it's critical to find a low cost electric see supply um in order to make it um economic or close to economic um and here in the us you know the economics certainly have to factor in that today um there's a very low cost supply of natural gas um making it you know the imperative that you you find a cheap electricity supply you know it's early um you know never say never on on you know where we might find opportunities to invest in the business but historically um as you know we've not uh played in the space of of own being uh you know being a vertically integrated uh you know owner of technologies or projects uh we've typically um taken the best of uh manufactured equipment from other folks um you know apply our scale and our ability to construct own and operate over the long term effectively is where we create value um so again it's early but at this point i wouldn't think that we would focus on vertical integrating it's more of um you know applying hydrogen as a as a technology consistent the ways that we've created value in the past so so the only thing i would add to that two things one is i'd be disappointed if uh in john's business we don't make some some kind of pilot investment in the next year uh we're looking at a variety of things and uh and i'd be disappointed if we don't make some kind of pilot investment in the next year a very very much tone of water like we did a decade ago in the battery storage business uh secondly uh you know clearly we're not gonna backward integrate into manufacturing uh electric wises or anything like that but uh i wouldn't i wouldn't rule out us owning them as part of a uh integrated system that was integrated with renewables to manufacturer hydrogen and and as you know our view would around that would be if we had a long-term contract and obviously we have access to very uh efficient capital we know how to operate uh equipment um we're you know and so a lot of that would would come to our uh i think uh our strategic advantages in terms of how we how we're able to create value for folks so you know i i think it i think it's early we're we're we are there's clearly an opportunity to uh you know five to you know five to ten years from now to displace the last ten percent of the carbon emissions out of the electric sector by manufacturing hydrogen and with renewables that's clear i think there's also clearly an opportunity to make renewables to display diesel fuel and perhaps even other types of transportation fuel going forward and and there's also i think clearly uh an opportunity to make green hydrogen to uh to uh to replace other types of hydrogen or and other feed stocks and industrial app locations and so we're looking at all of that and we're not you know we're not being uh all of that in the end comes back to uh a very important thing which is this is gonna drive gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts and gigawatts of renewable demand in this country and so there is no one better position than us to take advantage of that and we are gonna be just like we were in battery storage we are gonna be at the vanguard we're gonna and we're gonna this is a big strategic initiative for us and we're gonna drive it and uh it's gonna be very important uh for this company i think not you know over the next over the next decade we won't make any money on it in the next five years just like we didn't make any money in batteries in the first five year and and next year we're we're deploying a billion dollars of batteries uh ten years later and so that's that's the way i think about this i think about this is is help powering the long-term growth of this company into uh the back half of this decade in the in the next decade as well got it that's really helpful thank you so much for those comments um i just had one other quick m and a followup i was just wondering uh if uh is there any path for texas to be a target um of interest for you from an mna perspective or what would need to change there thanks so we we we uh we have uh spent a lot of i'm in texas obviously we own assets in texas and so uh we are a great operator and uh and and we feel like we would bring an enormous amount of state we we own billions of dollars of assets in the state right and we're a great great partner for the state and so uh you know i would never say never uh you know obviously uh we were extraordinarily disappointed in the encore decision we think it was uh uh a mistake and uh shortsighted but you know that is what it is um and uh so it's probably gonna take a bit to get past that uh before uh i'm super excited about doing things in texas from an elimination understood understood thank you very much our next question comes from michael <unk> from goldman sachs please go ahead with your question hi good morning everybody thanks you for taking my question um i want to turn the floor on for a second you're supposed to file rate cases next year uh at both utilities and obviously the combination of the two will be a big step that is there any potential for being able to delay or defer the timing of the rate cases to ac what happens from a caps perspective in in dc from a public policy perspective just so you don't have to go back to the regulator two or three times over a two or three year period um and is there any scenario where you may not even need a rate case or rate what we good morning michael and and uh we appreciate the uh the question um as as i've commented i think even in in these prep or remarks um we do continue to believe um that fpl and goal would file for a combined rate case in early twenty twenty one for me rates effective in twenty twenty two um as you highlighted there's there's some uncertainties and certain factors that could change um but that's the reality of operating any business um you know what you know those days and and you do the best you can for for planning for uncertainties and um we certainly would contemplate um changes that we are aware of at the time um but you know you gotta keep running your business and what's most important from our perspective is continuing to have the ability to invest in florida power and light and invest at gulf power um in these great opportunities that we see uh for the benefit of our customers you know we continue to lead the industry in o and m cost we continue to lead the industry in reliability and customer service um and the best way to keep doing that is execute um and that means occasionally having rate cases um we are uh excited about that prospect we've been preparing for it for a long time um and we think we have um a great story to tell um and we welcome the opportunity to talk about the things that we've been doing at fpl and golf uh so the right for now you know obviously things could change but for now we continue to have those plans to file in twenty one for new rates effect of twenty twenty two got it and one other question just on the florida utilities you have been the industry leader in terms of cost management do you think the pace of two and o and m cost declines will stay at this level meaning the year over year change or decline rates do you think you're reaching a point where it'll start to flatten out where the ability to continue to take out as much cost as you've done every year we'll start to slide the short answer to that michael is we've got a very creative team and we've got a team that is focused on continuous improvement and not afraid of that um but let me also not underestimate you know what that require and that requires um the ability to identify those new technologies and take that cost out over uh over time um so there's you know we have to work for it um and so every year we we pull together and come up with our best ideas uh do we think over the long period of time that we've exhausted every opportunity um no in part because i think technology will continue to enhance our abilities to do that but it takes time to execute those opportunities um so our discipline is there our creativity is there our innovation um our commitment to continuous improvement and we're gonna do the best we can to create the best value for our customers thank you
