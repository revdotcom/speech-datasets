strong on before the pandemic and we are now seeing the strength continue through the third quarter as a result of more fully open channels plus positive trends and digital engagement outdoor pursuits a focus on hygiene and individual use and people taking your home vacations these dynamics support the robust demand we are seeing across the product portfolio and particularly both hard and soft

now offer broader products for hard sellers and large cans while currently limited to ddc we're also encouraged by the early success of our rambler cannot tumbler which has mentioned earlier was

again support boarding for breast cancer and casting for recovery our fourth year with both of these incredible organizations we also expanded our rambler elements metallic collection to the culture and logo and extended sage brush from coolers into drinkwear i would like to take a moment to address the voluntary recall which was announced yesterday in part ship with the us consumer product safety commission of the rambler twenty ounce travel mug with our strong gold lid we launched the travel mug on october first as our newest travel ready product however shortly after our limited initial launch on getty dot com and in our retail stores we discovered a potential safety issue with a stronger lid and out of an abundance of caution decided to pull the product from these channels and voluntarily begin work with the cpsc to date there have been no report of injuries from customers to put this recall in perspective we sold less than fifteen thousand units during the nine days it was available in the direct channels of the approximately two hundred and forty two thousand total produced mugs mentioned in our release the addition we did not ship the product to our wholesale partners customer safety is our priority which is why we took such an aggressive stance addressing this issue we're actively engaged in working on an enhanced design that will continue to meet the highest standards that our customers place on each and every product carrying the eddie brand this delay while disappointing in the near term is fully contemplated in our outlook and will continue to make us better in addition to our lineup of new products launched this year we are continuing to energize some of our existing categories as part of our marketing strategy to drive broaden awareness this includes the come hell or high water campaign in early july that showcase the versatility and perform of our paying a fully submersible bags more recently are built for generations yet ev series films launched digitally on yeti social are centered around our innovative premium stainless steel cooler which is designed to be passed down through the generations expect continued targeted product storytelling through the holidays with our holiday gift guides and upcoming yeti dispatch magalog which will begin to drop mid november we also remain laser focused on working towards rebuilding in stock levels as a reminder to protect our balance sheet in late q1 we initially reduced purchase orders at the start of the pandemic and as demand recovered we have worked to flex our supplier capacity to meet writing demand with demand accelerating in the third quarter coupled with some pandemic driven supply disruption through the summer and early fall production we expect inventory will remain tight through the holidays we have taken additional action to mitigate risk and increase visibility of our supply chain during the holidays but do expect our overall restocking initiatives will extend into early two thousand twenty one as we look at the balance of the year we remain focused on driving deeper engagement across the ed portfolio and executing in stock across all channels looking at our omni channel efforts consumer dynamics are clearly accelerating the digital shift and building upon the activities we have been driving for the past five years along with the heightened focus of our brands him and delivering amazing highly relevant digital content we're taking additional action to drive greater consumer acquisition and conversion through investments and incremental consumer insights and behavior work and enhanced product customization experience new data tools and talent additions to our team this is work that will evolve as we match the speed of our customer's purchasing habits and the rapidly evolving consumer expectations the biggest proof point of our success here is our direct consumer business which grew sixty two percent and reached fifty one percent of total sales this period and year to date our strong third quarter dc performance was led by yeti dot com due to excellent traffic and conversion on the site we continue to see a great mix of new versus existing customers and have maintained great engagement as a result of our targeted and relevant content rounding out our online presence the amazon marketplace continue to post solid growth through the quarter on the corporate sales side revenues turned slightly positive for the quarter as healthy demand was limited by inventory availability increased capacity and delivery for custom is our focus as we ramp through the holiday season in ye retail we added our eight location in west palm beach in august we continue prioritizing operational excellence in all our stores while also monitoring the real estate environment for opportunity as we evaluate store expansion potential for twenty twenty one turning to wholesale demand and channel fell through remained robust retailers were able to support demand with insert inventory however they did in the quarter with inventory down double digits compared to the prior year we have opportunity to drive strong in stocks particularly in high demand areas such as hard coolers and soft coolers which had significant sell through during the quarter as a wholesale business evolves we're working to support the expanded omni capabilities of our wholesale partners through their own e-commerce curbside and in store which combined are expected to be an important part of this holiday season we had a very strong performance in our international business quarter with international wholesale more than doubling while international e-commerce quadrupled in size still off a low base but showing great potential overall international grew a hundred and sixty five percent to reach seven percent of sales the highest mix yeti has registered today the the biggest factor in the growth was the reopening of our canadian wholesale which delivered significant year of year growth this quarter importantly the dtc side of the canadian business including both e-commerce and corporate sales also registered exponential growth during the period while canada still drives the majority of our current international business we continue to be highly encouraged with demand we see in other markets australia showed more than a threefold increase in both the wholesale and e-commerce businesses due to the extraordinary performance and execution of our australian team as we hit the one year mark in our uk in europe expansion we're seeing this business build larger each quarter and we continue to see a meaningful opportunity to drive performance as retail real we remain highly focused on building the brand internationally in a thoughtful manner while developing the infrastructure to support smart sustainable growth outside of our strategic priorities we were excited to announce earlier this week the next step in our board evolution as our board of directors appointed alison dean former cfo of irobot as an independent director and a member of our audit committee alison brings over thirty years of fund ancient leadership experience including fifteen years with irobot and seven years as a company's cfo before stepping down earlier in twenty twenty allison's addition corresponds to the resignation of mike

opportunity for the brand i that pass the call over to paul i would again like to reiterate how thrilled we are with the holistic performance during the third quarter and i would like to thank our yeti team for their exemplary efforts and ability to adapt and thrive so well against a very challenging backdrop to our customers and partners who have continued to show their confidence and our products and our brand thank you while challenges remain pervasive in the headlines we are fully focused on our people and what we do best driving passion for the brand and delivering innovative product we look forward to building on the strength of our twenty twenty to date performance with strong execution through the holiday season and q4 paul thanks now and good morning everyone i'll begin with a review of our third quarter results followed by some high level thoughts as we look at the business during the holiday period we'll then open up the call for your questions starting with the third quarter net c increase twenty nine percent to two hundred ninety four point six million compared to two hundred twenty nine point one million in the prior year period representing our highest growth rate as a public company the moment into that built throughout the second quarter accelerated into the third given what we believe is a sustainable shift in consumer behavior towards outdoor leisure activities and related products this trend was highlighted by growth across our product categories and continued dtc dtc momentum even as our wholesale channel returned to growth and experienced either even stronger sell through during the quarter the looking at our channels direct to consumer net sales grew sixty two percent to a hundred fifty point four million compared to ninety two point nine million in the same period last year driven by strength in both cool was an equipment and drinker within dtc the yeti dot com business continue to lead the way the amazon marketplace posted strong growth in corporate sales increased slightly for the period the overall dtc reach fifty one percent of net sales for the period compared to forty one percent in last year's period wholesale net sales increase six percent to a hundred and forty four point two million compared to a hundred and thirty six point two million last year strong gains and drinkware helped us set declines and cooler and equipment which were largely driven by inventory constraints channel sell through was up double digits for the quarter so channel inventory exited the quarter down double digits on a year over year basis by category drink where return to strong growth during the quarter with net sales increasing thirty one percent to a hundred sixty five point nine million compared to a hundred twenty six point four million last year we are very pleased with the continued strength of our original drink wear excuse even as we introduce new products to address additional use cases for our customers our expanded culture lineup and updated bottle styles with chug cat remained big winners this year and we are also excited to see the early receptivity of our ten ounce rambler during the period coolers and equipment net sales increased twenty seven percent to a hundred and twenty four point two million compared to ninety seven point eight million during the same period last year our overall cooler business remains vibrant led by our new roady twenty four and the tundra hall in hard coolers and our flip and back flip lines and soft coolers we also saw strong results in our outdoor living category led by our trail head camp chair which we believe supports the broader opportunity of the brand as we develop and expand deeper into new categories gross profit increased forty five percent to a hundred seventy four million or fifty nine point one percent of net sales compared to a hundred and twenty point one million or fifty two point four percent of net sales during the same period last year the six hundred and seventy basis point year over year expansion was driven by the following favorable impacts two hundred ninety basis points from channel mix a hundred ten basis points from product cost improvements ninety basis points from lower tariffs seventy basis points from lower inbound freight seventy basis points from higher inventory reserves in the prior period in lower warranty expenses in the current period and lastly forty basis points from all other impacts adjusted sgna expenses for the third quarter increased by twenty two percent to a hundred and one point six million of thirty four point five percent of net sales as compared to eighty three point five million or thirty six point four percent of net sales in the same period last year variable sgna expenses leveraged a hundred fifty basis points driven by the significant shift in channel mix towards our faster growing dtc chance primarily with higher outbound freight non-variable sgna expenses leveraged three hundred fifty basis points driven by the overall strength of the company's top line results we continue to invest prudently to grow our business with higher year over year spending across most key expense categories including marketing while we also resumed hiring more broadly across the organization adjusted operating income increased ninety eight percent to seventy two point four million or twenty four point six percent of net sales compared to thirty six point six million or sixteen percent of net sales during the same period last year our effective tax rate was twenty four point four percent during the quarter compared to twenty ninety four point nine percent in last year's third quarter adjusted net income more than doubled to fifty three point five million or sixty one cents per diluted share compared to twenty three point two million or twenty seven cents per diluted chair during the prior year period adjusted ebitda increased eighty four percent to eighty point two million or twenty seven point two percent of net sales compared to forty three point seven million or nineteen point one percent of net sales in the same quarter last year now turning to our balance sheet as of september twenty six twenty twenty we had cash of two hundred and thirty four point eight million compared to thirty four point six million in the year ago period our strong cash balance in part reflects our lower inventory position as we ended the quarter with a hundred thirty four point six million inventory compared to two hundred nine point two million during the same quarter last inventory decline thirty six percent year over year reflecting both the comparison to a thirty three percent growth in the year ago period as well as ongoing efforts to match apply with the above forecasted demand we have seen across the business going forward our focus remains on flexing our supply chain to not only match the strong demand we have seen for the brand and also rebuild more consistent in stock levels across our channels as such we expect to be in a constrained inventory position across certain products as we work through the fourth quarter total debt excluding unmatized deferred financing fees and finance leases was two hundred thirty eight point eight million compared to two hundred ninety eight million in last the third quarter during the quarter we made principal payments of fifty three point eight million inclusive of a fifty million dollar voluntary prepayment and with our strong cash position for the quarter the ratio of total net debt to adjusted ebitda for the trailing twelve months was essentially zero times compared to one point six times in the prior year quarter overall we couldn't be proud of how our business and our team has responded since the beginning of the pandemic nonetheless we know there is more work to be done to navigate the ongoing uncertainties of that our environment to execute on our holiday plan and ultimately to continue our momentum into twenty twenty one given the incredible performance of our third quarter let me give you some high level thoughts into how we see the balance of the year playing out we expect fourth quarter net sales to increase between fifteen and sixteen percent year over year on top of the strong twenty four percent growth rate in last year's fourth quarter as a reminder the fourth quarter includes the impact of an extra week which extends the fiscal period to january second twenty twenty one it is expected to benefit revenues by approximately seven million dollars with our strong outperformance in the third quarter contributing to lean inventory across our channels we expect demand for the yeti brand will continue to exceed available supply during the fourth quarter as we focus on rebuilding our inventory positions we are also actively in aggressively managing all aspects of our supply chain to navigate real and potential disruptions from supplier capacity to holiday logistics we expect our ongoing work here we'll provide opportunities for growth as we continue to restock the channel into early twenty twenty one turning to the bottom line gap earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter are expected to be between fifty five and fifty eight cents compared to five cents in the year ago period we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be between fifty seven and sixty cents reflecting a thirty one to thirty eight percent year over a year growth before turning the call over for q and a i wanna reinforce three themes we are seeing in the business first we are seeing incredible demand for the eddie brand with growth evenly balance between our two main product categories and supported by our omni channel evolutions seconds we are focused on delivering profitable growth highlighted by record gross margins and discipline sga management lastly we continue to build more financial flexibility to support strategic opportunities and drive future shareholder value we believe these themes are the hallmarks of us strong enduring brand and positioned the company incredibly well as we look to achieve our long-term goals we would now like to open the call for questions operators thank you at this time will be conducting a question and answer session if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue you may press star two if you would like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys one moment please while we pull for questions your first question comes from a long of peter benedict with baird please proceed with your question oh hey guys good morning thanks for the questions um uh first first just on the inventory um paul i don't know if you can give us maybe a better sense of uh of where you where you hope to have this sitting at year end um and then assuming that demand um pace remains i guess similar uh when would you realistically expect to be better kind of in stock um at levels that would allow you to kind of grow with sell through is that something that you think you could get early in twenty one or if this demand level continues you're gonna be chasing for for quite some time that's my first question that one follow up great thanks peter in good morning so um we expect to end the year um still down on inventory but um it will make sequential improvement from where we are in the third quarter um so while down year over year um we we do expect to the percentage to lesson on a decrease year over year and then as we look into twenty twenty one um you know it's probably the first half of the year where we continue to you know um ramp up our inventory and it's really it's all about demand and what we're seeing today is demand is um very very strong and we hope that continues but we think as we go through twenty twenty one we'll get to a more normalized level okay that's that's helpful and then i guess related to that um just matt maybe talk about the the innovation cadence um in the business and i know you you guys adjusted some of the new product introductions this year just in response to covid and whatnot but now we've got the supply constraint dynamic out there so maybe just how is the how has your planning evolved for for two thousand for twenty twenty one in terms of what maybe you were thinking a year ago you would introduce um uh versus what now you think the cadence will look like peter thanks the uh in the morning you know i would say our planning and roadmap for twenty twenty one as it was to the product uh has not changed significantly um so the the changes we made in twenty twenty early in the year when we didn't uh have great visibility on the back half of the year and as we've previously communicated shifted some things to the front half of twenty twenty one we don't expect those to get caught up in the inventory rebuild in the kind of capacity that we're putting on or the pressure we're putting on our suppliers for capacity so we expect that that shouldn't have the a substantial impact on our product roadmap and the introduction of products next year it's really uh is paul uh indicated it's really rebuilding um the current product portfolio or current inventory uh backup so i feel like good about the innovation cadence being attacked in the plan for innovation in twenty twenty one and in parallel we'll be rebuilding and ramping up our supply capacity for our existing product portfolio okay that that's helpful i i i guess think one more and then i'll turn it over i i apologize just with respect to the recall i'm not i'm not sure how much you can say about it but i'm just curious what's different about that nag slider on the travel one versus the others i mean you got you have nag sliders on a lot of different products so if you're at liberty to say and then you said you know any impact is in your fourth court plan paul if there's you could go a little bit more specific behind what you think the impact's gonna be thank you yeah peter i'll i'll take the the front of that the you know we did a voluntary recall um in an abundance of caution and didn't have any we we had a report of a dislodging of our magnetic lid and so we quickly moved you know nine days into launch of this product through our own drug of channels and and took a took a decisive action quickly to make sure we fully understood and and fully wrap this the difference between the two products is in the uh legacy product there's one magnet on the top and on the new one there's a magnet on the on the magnet on the top and that's what they can uh dislodge from each other and so you know we put incredible importance on uh consumer safety and when we saw this report of it we had an opportunity to quickly quickly wrap it and uh and get it off the market put our team back to work on making sure that um we had the product out in the market that we thought was uh deserving of the eddy brand and then peter on the sales impact while i won't share kind of of what our plan was um and as you can imagine there are a lot of put some takes there as we introduce the new products how does that impact current product so when we pulled the uh travel mug you know they perceived cannibalization of other product goes away so um as we said it's fully contemplated in the um in the top line guidance that we gave in the fifteen to sixteen percent and um you know excited to as the team is reworking that led in um you know looking looking forward okay fair enough thanks thanks guys your next question comes from the line of camille line with b t i g please proceed with your question thank you good morning guys and uh great job on the quarter um i i wanted to drill down a little bit more on the inventory comments you're making i think you have some inventory constraints also um uh during the middle of the um and obviously continuing here in the fourth quarter maybe if you can help us um understand what categories you're feeling particularly light on and uh how you're thinking about um you know is there a favorite of a channel that you'd prefer to to supply over one over the other so are you in the feeder dtc uh first when supply comes back or is coming through and also are you seeing where in the supply chain are you seeing the disruptions is it on the production side is it um shipping times is it at the ports i'm just curious to understand um where the bottlenecks exist um and where we could see some alleviation of that uh of that inventory flow sure so let me start with um the kind of how we got here or kind of just um you know kind of going back a few months so if you remember back at the end of first quarter and this is this is where do we see the the bottlenecks um cause there really aren't true bottlenecks in the in the normal sense but if we go back to the first quarter at the end of the first quarter um last two weeks of the first quarter first two weeks of the second quarter we cut back forward pos um as we were seeing those demand signals we had some supply chain disruption there but it was really us cutting back looking at the current demand signals at that point and then demand started to in the back office so and quarter started to take off and we began placing forward orders and then as we came into q3 so it's really about a lot of this impact is you know kind of going back to the end of first quarter beginning a second quarter where we weren't producing at a capacity or we weren't producing at the level to support the twenty nine percent in q3 and you know back i never would've expected to drive twenty nine percent top line growth in the third quarter so it is really we have all our all our factories working you know full capacity and and producing so it's not a it's not a bottleneck in the sense of you know ports and things of that nature that being said you know and and you've seen it in the headlines the port coming into the into the us on the west coast um and then certainly just logistics and and getting the um the goods to our dcs but it really is about kind of the progression of rebuilding the inventory from an allocation um you know here's how we think about it is we want to meet consumer demand across channels and if we think about our wholesale channel right so our um sell-in was plus six percent and we talked about um wholesale demand being close to what our top line was in line with what our top line was as a company um so we knew we had inventory in the channel so we used that inventory to satisfy demand and then we used the inventory we had to satisfy our dtc so we're constantly looking at satisfying consumer to man um and that's kind of how we allocate um the inventory and we continue to do that um into the fourth quarter got it okay great um and then just on the categories is there a specific uh under inventory position that's more um that's more grave um maybe that's too strong a word but um that's that's that's of greater focus foolers versus drink or is it equally balanced in terms of where you'd like to be yeah good good question i'm gonna come at it from the other angle of we had the benefit of all last year building up my drinkwear inventory so even as i came into the the first quarter second quarter and i did the same thing there i cut forward pos but i had a lot of drinker inventory in my dc so as demand came back i was able to you know put forward pos in um for i had the benefit of having a lot of drinkware inventory which again as we talked about was a tariff mitigation and turned into a coronavirus mitigation um so that i was i benefited from that piece got it that's that's clear thank you um and then maybe matt as you think about this you know the balance of the the excess supply excess demand um or demand serving supply with maintaining the brand heat that you're clearly benefiting from um are you are you uh at all seen anything on the competitive landscape where um a customer is is leaving the brand just a fills and sort of purchase need um and and how are you trying to mitigate you know that uh potential loss sale or that loss customer that um you know maybe organically coming to you but not not seeing that demand fulfilled you know we see mean um through time and through different points in yeti's history when we get into supply constrained environments or where uh demand is outstripping supply is it we don't tend to see a lot of leakage uh of the of the customer and part is because we focus a lot on making sure we're continuing to drive engagement and even if it's engagement in between purchases or it's engagement while someone's waiting for something to come back and stock or we present alternative alternative products and i think is our one of the benefits of our in-house internal creative and content team combined with our e-commerce team is that we're able to identify more smartly where consumers are and where they are in the shopping journey and what we can put in front of them as an alternative so we tend to see uh we tend not to see that leakage and you know as a as a reminder this business pre mid-march and pre the pandemic shut down here in the us was growing twenty plus percent we just grew twenty nine percent in in the third quarter uh we provided some some outlook on on the fourth quarter to expect the back half of the year to return to that twenty percent growth this is the business that was driving performance and consume we're demand as we as we went through that time and and we're continuing to do it right now and and we'll work hard to make sure we keep consumers engaged while uh while we get our in-stock back at the level both in wholesale and our own dtc channels in the way we want it fantastic good luck in holiday season thanks guys excellent your next question comes from the line of alexandra wallace with goldman sachs please proceed with your question good morning thanks so much for taking the question here my first question is on e-commerce e-commerce of course growing uh very very strongly so in the quarter and you mentioned that was um you saw growth across channels could you talk about the discrepancy and growth that you'll see um between nike dot com and amazon marketplace you know what's the mix of the e-commerce business today between those channels and how would you expect that to um trend uh going forward alex good morning um so jenny dot com and uh i may said this in my prepared remarks jenny dot com definitely led the way so if i think about um the dtc business jenny dot com was the leader then amazon and then corporate sales and i'm and i'm leaving retail out just because of the year over year comparison um with new stores doesn't make the the percent um growth relevant um so yay dot com is still the store august um you know we like what we're seeing across those channels um and are really happy with the engagement with driving with yeti dot com you know the amazon marketplace is an important business for us we saw a know this is going back to the end of uh in this q1 the slight you know disruption as people were really focused on more essentials but that has come back nicely and is growing um very very well but clearly the uh the standout was yada dot com okay great many plans so you know which which of those you're prioritizing as you um as you move forward in the coming courses in the years so prioritize thing and i'm gonna you can ask you can come back at me and i'm gonna step away from prioritizing inventory but really if you think about the coming years we really like the yeti dot com business um it's the fullest expression of our business it's where we get you know the most information from a customer and and being able to interact with a customer so you know if we could wave if i could wave a magic wand i'd have everyone go to yeti dot com that being said you know the amazon marketplace is real important if people choose for now a hundred nineteen dollars a year if they're a prime member and they go to buy you know something and they wanna put a um rambler twenty in their cart we wanna be where the customer wants to shop so that's kind of how we think long term is and that goes as far as wholesale too is being where the customer wants to access the brand is the most important thing to us that's super i appreciate you sharing your thoughts on that um maybe one more from me i wonder if you to update us on um the business with lows uh how many doors you are now how that's trending and and what the uh what the next step and the opportunity is there yeah alex matt i'll i'll take that one um thanks thanks for the question and and good morning you know we continue to uh really enjoy the relationship that we've built with lows in the partnership and and that's that's as important to us as we think about what a methodical pace role it looks like we said that from the very beginning that the the rationale for why we add additional wholesale is that they bring a relatively new consumer a new buying occasion or they they augment support the rest of our existing wholesale and and i glove has continued to do that and been a and been a good partner as we have uh evolved and and learned together you know this year um we're incredibly pleased with our partnership we made some decisions as the year uh based on to moderate our rollout considering the environment and considering our inventory constraints and it gave us an opportunity to really focus on uh the execution and performance so what uh what we really like as we continue to see the incrementality of that relationship and and we look at it as a piece in the puzzle of our overall wholesale and our overall wholesale is a piece in the puzzle of our overall omnichannel so we're uh we're pleased with uh with how that's performing and as we see at the uh in the in the prepared remarks and we've reiterated here we're pleased with the overall performance our whole self and our job now is to uh to thoughtfully rebuild uh the channel inventory so that uh we continue to address uh more and more of the con super demand fantastic thanks so much and all the best thanks alex your next question comes from line of randy conic with jeffries please proceed with your yeah uh good morning everybody um you know clearly the the the strong revenue numbers the growth of revenue is indicative of you know acceleration of new customer grow and existing customers you know buying more and i remember i recall number a number of quarters ago you guys were starting to track uh the purchase behavior or kind of track customers on what they're doing so is there any kind of color you can give us when you analyze the gtc business of what proportion of the revenues are coming from you know new brand new customers versus existing customers right now randy good morning this matt what i would say is um we haven't as you as you pointed out we haven't shared the specific numbers it is something that we've um we continue to get smarter and have better insights to you know i made a a comment a little bit earlier that you know we're we're focused on um understanding those customer cohorts and how they perform and how they perform differently and as our product portfolio expands uh what that sequencing of purchases and what that recurrence of purchase looks like what i can say is interestingly through this year to date as we have seen elevated demand and has channel shifts have uh have occurred during different points of shutdown and wholesale is our new to yeti dot com versus existing or repeat purchase on yeti dot com uh has all lifted and and that ratio between the two hasn't shifted materialally and so we we we really like the new customer acquisition that we're seeing and the percent of new customers we're seeing and uh along with that we like the the returning customer and the repeat purchase rate and and what we're really focused on is you know what is their behavior after that first purchase within those first thirty days and then those first ninety days and within that first uh first year and so those are all metrics uh we're we're paying a lot of attention to and then below that um what does that what does that basket of expansion uh expansion look like so what we aren't reporting uh the numbers uh it is something we're paying a lot of attention to is something we're taking action on um and it's something we like the trend that we're seeing and it's it's a big area investment for the business in twenty twenty and that'll continue to be a big area of investment in twenty twenty one as we drive deeper uh consumer insights and behavior understandings to to really target those distinct uh those distinct audiences that's great um and then last question uh you mentioned i believe the international penetration is at at uh seven percent of total i believe it was only four percent you know only a few quarters ago so can you give us some extra uh depth of color on you know what you think is happening in terms of right rising awareness or what what have you just trying to get a sense of the acceleration you're seeing cause it seems like that business is now starting to kind of really come into its own that that that geography if you will the international and just want to get some color on what you think is starting to really continue to accelerate that uh that business going that part of the uh sales geography going forward thank you yeah yeah we're we're ready we're super excited about the opportunity internationally we have been um but what we're we're excited about now is our enthusiasm is being matched by uh the activity and results and i say that fully knowing that wholesale or retail in europe in the uk in australia and in canada til q3 was was really disrupted by the pandemic and i would say disrupted in some cases even more than the us wholesale market so what we saw in the quarter was a really strong recovery in our international business and it came back it came back a what we liked was we saw strong performance of our wholesale led by the canadian wholesale which is a market that we've been actively in directly with yeti employees operating in since two thousand seventeen but balance with that wholesale is strong e-commerce performance and and i think that is indicative of the rising awareness of the brand um you know i think that things like social media the content we create um that type of information has been more and more democratized globally and so the awareness of our brand and the awareness of our products um in in many cases in some of the markets we internationally leads our official entry or leads um the the distribution we have in those markets cause social media is such a uh such a globally democratized um and available so we continue to focus on uh we see the demand signals we believe the brands bigger than the revenue are focused uh continue to be on holding our brand in the right way so we're not rushing out uh just a taste uh short term placement or short term growth uh we really want the sustainable growth and we're seeing that in canada in australia in particular where we've been operating for three full years and we're seeing the early signs of it in the uk in europe and what we like about the uk in europe in the early days is even with the disruption through the summer in there uh in the wholesale channel um that e-commerce continues to be to be a strong opportunity so i think you up for us to go into twenty twenty one with a heavy focus around international i have focused around brand building and driving ultimately the question you asked which is driving the awareness which we think ultimately drives a consideration in the purchase very helpful thanks guys thank you ready your next question comes from the line of sharon <unk> with william blair please proceed with your question hi good morning so question on on the operating margin you've obviously had um a couple of quarters in a row where operating margin has started with the two and it looks like the indication is that that will continue in the fourth quarter and that like for the full year um i guess i'd be interested in paul and how twenty twenty has changed any of your thoughts about the long term sustainable margin of the company and also if there are any um any areas where you like you're over earning this year because you've pulled back on marketing or or travel or other dynamics if you could kind of dimensionalize those for us yeah um good morning sharon so the performance than the operating margin expansion um and the performance has been fantastic so as i think about that and then thinking about going forward obviously that's driven by the significant increase in direct to consumer um and the shift that we've seen both um in the second quarter and the third quarter but even if we go back to the to the first quarter in in the whole algorithm of the company of dtc growing faster than wholesale um so a lot of that uh margin expansion is driven a gross margin expansion as we look to the to the future um a couple of thoughts the first is we expect gross margin with mix shift in cost improvements to continue to expand i don't expect it to expand to the level it did this year because of the significant outperformance of dtc and then as you know just the the law of large numbers my dtc becomes a bigger percent of the business every incremental one percent mix gives me less on the mix but we do believe um gross margin will continue to benefit from mix shift cost improvements um and then i will say we talk very often in really about where do we want to um are there things we want to invest at the course margin level are there things we want to invest in the in the product and i think you saw that and we've talked about this when we put the chug cap on the bottle and didn't change the price um so we delivered value to the consumer um and how for the pricing we use some of that gross margin expansion um to fund that from a um over-earning in the business i think the most obvious one then you called it out as t and e right so um we're still working remotely and not traveling um so certainly t and e is down you know we continue and and even though um we saw a significant lever on non-variable expenses um you know we continue to invest in in absolute dollars um we continue to spend more in marketing we've resumed hiring so you know we continue to bring great talent into the business um and things of that nature so the um expense leverage is really about kind of the top line growth but other than t and e um you know we are running the business and investing in the business um for the future so i don't feel like we're over-earning to use your words um based on you know cutting back on expenses thanks that's very helpful your next question comes from line of robbie owns with bank of america securities please proceed with your question oh thanks guys uh you know great order the um actually just two quick questions um you you mentioned uh you know sort of some new drivers or growth to the brand outdoor uh you know near home vacations things like that near the beginning of the call i guess um matt is there any um you when you get beyond the the inventory constraints and you look out you know the next year or two um are you looking at are there some new wholesale type customers that you guys are thinking about now because of these new drivers of demand for the brand um that you maybe were thinking about a year ago robbie i would i would answer that in good morning a couple different ways you know these the drivers that have become kind of the headlines through through the summer and some of the drivers we mentioned uh i would say for our brand have been dynamic that we've been experiencing uh for the last handful of years that that movement towards being active outdoors um adventure based vacations uh know car camping all those dynamics i think what's happened in the summers it's just it's accelerated exposure of a trend that we were seeing and obviously our benefit our business was was benefiting from strong growth pre-pandemic and and as those trends get highlighted and people uh try those things were were right in that in that uh slip stream to to continue to sustain that momentum um you know if it were different and we were zero growth and realized growth because of a trend um it would be a different time and that's just not that's not the situation we're in um i couple that with because we were uh we think we were well positioned pre-pandemic and and previous trends being highlighted uh we believe we've got really good representation from a wholesale perspective uh domestically and we think that uh between the amazon marketplace and yeti dot com we've got good good representation that said as we've said in the past uh we constantly monitor the wholesale market uh we for uh everything from independent partners who help us uh identify a certain region or a certain customer group that we may not be accessing uh all the way up to uh larger national but is is you know uh having followed us for a while we're really thoughtful when we bring on a big partner we were thoughtful when we added lows to the to the suite of wholesale partners we have so we feel good where we are today but we also pay attention to to the market i think internationally is a different a different situation we that's a little more greenfield for us when it comes to to wholesale exposure and so far we've been following a similar playbook to the us which is building strong relevant independent relationships and and identifying um regional players or in some cases national players that we think uh will will represent the brand in the business well that that's helpful and then paul just quickly shipping search charges anything uh any impact to you guys you see uh you know for the fourth quarter or next year yeah so um from a dollar perspective it's all we are seeing you know the search charges that um ups has announced um all contemplated in the fourth quarter outlook and and robbie what i would say is what we're really focused on and and not to um play down the the dollar piece of it it's really the capacity and making sure you know that we secure and we work with ups i think our guys probably talk to 'em if not every day three times a week we have secured our capacity for the fourth quarter um and that's really our biggest focus and again not to downplay the dollars but making sure we have uh making sure they're coming to pick up the trailers is um absolutely critical um and we have a very good relationship with them and our ops team is um very focused on that terrific thanks so much thanks robbie your next question comes from the line of peter keith with piper sandler please proceed with your question hey uh thanks and one of guys um i wanna follow up uh a prior question i think from kimlo uh just regarding the uh the inventory data stocks at wholesale so it seems like kind of a good news bad news situation uh remarkably strong sell through but inventory constrained and now you're going into how day season um it seems like there could be some risk where your wholesale partners might bring in some alternative uh competitors to fill in uh some of those cooler auto stocks what actions can you take in order to prevent that type of act of the ndc that is any risk uh in the coming months peter i would say a couple things to that um one we have great wholesale partnerships and and have very open dialogues as we uh as we've gone through this and as we've seen challenges to the supply disruption um you know one of the things that we've worked very closely with our wholesale partners is how do we fill in either with other yeti products or uh make sure that we're we're represented um as well as we can as we rebuild that space you know one of the one of the conversations we have is uh you know as we rebuild that inventory we wanna make sure that we have the right space to merchandise the products the right way and the way that we did pre-pandemic in the way we would expect of all of our wholesale partners um as at any point but as we rebuild that inventory so i would say the conversations have been great we're in full alignment with our partners so we don't see we don't see risk from uh uh something changing because of this moment in time we also don't see risk as far as uh as i mentioned earlier on the called demand leakage you know we want to continue to drive demand for our product we continue to bring uh innovation to market we've uh started previewing our spring products with our wholesale partners and uh there's a lot of excitement about uh about what we continue to do with the brand and what we continue to do from an innovation perspective okay uh thanks matt i'll ask a next question to paul all just around the the structure of the guidance so with the the fifteen to sixteen percent uh growth it does imply a notable acceleration from q3 and we know there's a lot of uncertainty in the uh economic environment uh but is there anything i identifiable uh that you can see that would that would cause that slow down and then uh maybe on a related note that the eps uh growth guidance of thirty one to thirty eight is certainly above normal for sort of your your normal mid teams uh of new growth so what are the the margin characteristics that's driving that above average eps growth and so a couple of things on the top line and as we think about this um if you step back to the end of second cool order um where we said the back half of the year would be fourteen to um between ten and fifteen percent um and now the back half of the year is um gonna be you know on if you look at what we've talked about for the fourth quarter call twenty percent so as we look from where we were three months ago you know the business has certainly performed and it's really about a very strong q3 so the the deceleration i i think about it a little bit differently of the back half of the year from where i thought about it three months ago is actually stronger than what i was making three months ago um you know as we think about the fourth quarter in particular um you know a couple of a couple things the first is you know we're up against our strongest comparison from last year to plus twenty three in last year's fourth quarter you know we talked about the inventory constraints um so those that's what kind of shaped our thinking on the um current outlook but again as i think of the back half of the year strongly outperforming what we thought the back half of the year was going to be just um three months ago from an eps perspective um or a margin and it's going to be um i'm happy to say much of the same we're gonna see expanding gross margins now we're rolling over fourth quarter always is our biggest dtc quarter every year um so it you know the hurdles certainly gets gets higher but if i think about gross margins i'm gonna expect some gross margin i'm gonna expect gross margin expansion from the channel mix shift costing improvements and then um tariff tailwind and then if i think about and gna um kind of come down the pnl it's gonna be a similar story overall of de-leveraging on the variable because of the mix shift so really driven by mix shift and then i expect the non-bear year bowl um to be roughly from a leverage perspective if you roughly flat-ish year over year um from a um leverage not a dollar obviously the dollars will will increase so that's that's what's driving operating margin down to um you know if you're talking about get down to eps obviously um my lower interest um both from a and that would be the last one uh that i hit the the balance of debt and then because i have a floating rate debt as you all know um interest rates are just um in my favor and as i deliver my pricing i go down on the grid of less expensive um spreads i okay that's all very helpful keep up the good work guys and uh good luck with holiday great thanks your final question comes from line of matt cornda with roth capital partners please for with your question yeah hey guys thanks for sneaking me in here um uh just wanted to touch on twenty twenty one again if i could i know it's been covered a little bit but wanted to see did we get any new categories that that add to growth as we look out into twenty twenty one or is it still the existing drink wear and cooler categories and just replenishment into wholesale and then sustained strength and dtc uh just wanted to get your take on that first no we haven't we haven't communicated any kind of forward category expansion um we tend not to talk about our forward product roadmap what i would say is you know we can tell you look for expansion opportunities within our existing products and in our existing product families and and if you look at our history of pacing over the last few years we continue to kind of push the edge of of new product families and i would act as we go into twenty twenty one that that's gonna continue you know we wanna keep reinvigorating our longest standing product families and introduce uh introduce new new families and and continue to expand um underneath the the the permission the eighty brand and the eighty consumers have given us to to bring more products to market got it it sounded like paul did you wanna add anything cause it sounds like you were jumping in there as well nope that was it okay great good good good that very helpful uh and then just a lot of the other stuff has been answered but on the balance sheet what i was curious about is i mean as we sort of get into a very high quality situation where you've got essentially the returns of leverage um how do we think about cash deployment going forward obviously we're gonna see plenty of investment in organic growth we understand that but when we think about sort of return of cash versus m and a and the prioritization there just curious to get your thoughts going forward you matt there's really you know we think about it in three in three buckets right now for what we would spend our cash on first and foremost is rebuilding our inventory to level that we believe is the right level to support the growth across our omni channel so number one's number one's inventory the second one is capex investments and the capex investments fall within a couple of different categories they fall within our um the continued digitization of the business and our technology investments and they fall on the product side and the product side splits into two things it's investment in capacity uh as we continue to ramp uh legacy products and it's investment in new product development and then the third thing is and we communicate this in the past uh at as we contemplate strategic m and a you know one of the things that uh i like to always say is uh we like the eddie brand a lot we think there's a lot of expansion opportunity underneath the eddie brand but as we look at m and a we look at it across really two two fronts one uh r and d investment in technologies or materials that help accelerate our existing product roadmap or a strategic acquisition that helps accelerate entry into relevant categories uh and that that can bring a category expansion it could bring customer based expansion it could bring geographic expansion so that's really it's really the way with the way we look at it internally we also feel very fortunate to be sitting here with two hundred thirty five million dollars in cash in a in a highly coming out of a highly uncertain summer so uh you know we feel good about the opportunities in front of us to return the value to shareholders um but first and foremost through growth great thanks for that matt uh i'll jump back to you ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the question and answer session and i would like to turn the call back to mr matt rankes for closing remarks thanks everybody for joining it's day uh i just wanna reiterate uh the incredible quarter we had it yet uh demand continues to be strong to the brand uh we love the receptivity we're seeing to our continued innovation um you know the brand was strong and the business was strong before the pandemic uh we're thrilled to be sitting here at the end of the third quarter and looking out to the fourth quarter um with a with a business that continues to perform and deliver i wanna wish everybody a safe uh and and happy end of the year and holiday season look forward to speaking to you as we as we wrap up the fourth quarter operator this concludes today's conference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation
