tran cfo mike <unk> following my opening remarks mike will review the quarterly financial performance in detail and then we'll take any questions that you may have i'd like to begin by expressing our concerns sympathy for those affected by the ongoing global pandemic that has touched our employees customers partners and suppliers the current times have changed the way we communicate work and and i remain encouraged by our perseverance and the faith of such adversity with these challenges it is more critical than ever to connect people communities and businesses with each other the results for our third quarter demonstrate solid execution against our plan this included broad based demand across our customer segments with regional and emergency service providers leading delay we were also making great progress with tier one fiber access projects that we announced earlier this year and continue to have very strong women to my new customer acquisition across a broad base of market segments from a top line perspective revenue for the quarter was a hundred thirty three point one million with forty four point three percent plus margins network solutions accounted for eighty seven percent of the revenue at a hundred fifteen point two while global services contributed seventeen point nine million during the quarter we had one ten percent service provider customer and one ten percent distribution partner along with strong contributions from both our direct and distribution channel partners that serve the regional broadband service provider market we added thirty eight new service provider customers during the quarter bringing the totals to ninety nine for the first three quarters of twenty these new customers range from global tier one operators to electric co-op cooperatives municipalities cable mso and regional broadband providers the new customer attraction remains positive reinforcing our belief that we are in early stages of a generational communications infrastructure network upgrade cycle driven by a confluence of favorable government regulatory technology and competitive factors the strength we saw during the quarter we fueled by our continuing momentum with regional broadband operators who were up sixty percent year over year and thirty three percent quarter over quarter we were also helped with a solid performance for our us tier two customers who were eight up eighteen percent year year as they started to emerge from restructuring and to again investing in their network expansions in europe our revenue from emerging alt net providers was up seventy six percent year of the year and twenty percent quarter of the quarter and highlighting are highlighting our growth in our region for the third quarter our fiber access and aggregation business groups thirty four percent over the previous period and increased sixty to six percent on a year over year basis this continued used to be our top sales category within fiber access our pono lt revenue grew thirty one percent quarter over quarter and a strong seventy seven percent year over year which we believe is significantly out pacing to growth in the general market and will continue to step up our market share position in this key segment we also saw strong revenue contribution from our us regional broadband service providers going thirty seven percent over the previous period and fifty eight percent over the previous year for the broad based growth about across both direct and distribution channels from a supply chain perspective lead times remained extended on some key components and vendors but our operations team took several proactive steps to mitigate logistics and component availability challenges to meet our customer's needs in our efforts to address these needs we have increased our inventory levels and including increased freight costs due to decreased capacity associated with higher transportation rates and expedites from an organizational perspective the structural changes that we have implemented over the last twelve months continue to improve our operational efficiency the company has achieved material reductions in operating expenses through control and expense management and we are ahead of our plan for the target operating model moving forward on the product side we are focusing on growing our wallet share with our service provider customers in addition to selling fiber active lp we are growing our residential gateway business the residential gateway revenue grew twenty two percent quarter over quarter and a strong sixty four percent year over year as we increase the number of llt customers also buying our rgs by seventeen percent year today i in addition to rd attach rates we have also focused on increasing attach rates for mosaic software subscription services as we migrate customers for mosaic suite in our upcoming mosaic one virtual control center on october twenty ninth yesterday began this nine hundred four options for sixteen billion of art off broadband subsidies there are three hundred eighty six qualified bidders that represent over seven hundred operators whereas the connect american fund was targeted to the large pr price cat carrier is providing a first right of views of the art associates provide an opportunity for rule local exchange carriers and community broadband providers such as rural electric phillips to receive ten years of funding we expected the art of funding to begin to positively impact our revenue beginning in the mid twenty twenty one timeframe in europe and around the world is strategic importance of 5g and fi provide my infrastructure is causing governments to carefully reconsider the security risks of their networks and implementation policies and are implementing policies to ban high risk vendors for participating in these network fields as a result ad tran stands out as a safe technically advanced alternative to as high risk vendors as national operators look to limit cap or replace high risk vendors in their network twenty twenty has brought forth a number of challenges that none of us could have envisioned however we have risen to these challenges in our urging as an even stronger and more resilient company we have achieved much thus far in twenty twenty with the material benefits of just beginning to bear fruit and as they start to begin more to be more fully recognized nice next year we have much to be excited about including the growing number of new customers selecting our products and services to build out our upgrade and networks with rapid adoption of our mosaic platform and subscription service and our sdx solutions as chairman operators begin their transition to the network of the future and the promise of art awards and begin and being able to help regional service providers utilities and municipalities provide you get the services to the communities that they serve i am proud of our company and our employees for the success we've seen this far this year we look forward to a strong finish to twenty twenty and have a bright outlook as we look ahead into twenty twenty and michael not provided an overview of financials and following his remarks i have a little bit up to any questions that you may have thank you tom and good morning to all i will review our thankfully as well and provide our view from fourth quarter of twenty twenty during my report i will be referencing both gap and non gap results with respect to non gap financial measures that are discussed on this call but are not presented in our earnings release reconciliations to their comparable gap measures are published in a supplemental financial schedule that appears on our investor relations webpage at www dot adtran dot com for non-gap measures discuss on this call that are presented in the earnings release reconciliations are contained within the release to supplemental financial schedules on our webpage also present certain revenue information by segment and category and other non gap reconciliations which i will be discussing today with tom said at trans third quarter revenue came in at one hundred and thirty three point one million compared to one hundred and twenty point seven million in the prior quarter and one hundred and fourteen point one million for the third quarter of twenty nineteen breaking this down across our operating segments our network solutions red the new for the third quarter was one hundred and fifteen point two million versus one hundred and eleven point three million reported for q2 of twenty twenty and ninety four million in q3 of twenty nineteen our services and support revenue in q3 of this year was seventeen point nine million compared to seventeen point four million reported in the second quarter of twenty twenty and twenty point one million for the third quarter of twenty nineteen across our revenue categories access and aggregation revenue for quarter three of twenty twenty was eighty five point four million compared to eighty two point eight million in the prior quarter and sixty five point one million in quarter three of twenty nineteen revenue for our subscriber solutions and experience category was four three point one million for the quarter versus forty point four million in quarter two of twenty twenty and forty two point five million in quarter three of twenty nineteen traditional and other products revenue for the quarter was four point six million compared to five point five million for quarter two of twenty twenty and six point five million for quarter three of twenty nineteen looking at our revenues geographically domestic revenue for q3 twenty twenty with ninety two point eight million versus eighty four point five million reported in quarter two of twenty twenty and eighty three point one million in quarter three of twenty nineteen our international revenue for the quarter was forty point three million compared to forty four point three million for quarter two of twenty twenty and thirty point nine million in quarter three of twenty nineteen for the third quarter we had two ten percent of revenue customers both of these were domestic customers our gap gross margin for the third quarter of this year was forty four point three percent as compared to forty one point five percent last quarter and forty point six percent in the third quarter of twenty nineteen non-cap gross margin for quarter three was forty four point five percent as compared to forty one point six percent in the prior quarter and forty one percent in the third quarter of twenty nineteen the quarter over quarter increase in both gap and non gap gross margins were driven by increases in volume as as well as favorable product and services mixed and lower fight related charges in the current quarter the increases in both gap and non gap growth margins on a year over year basis were driven by end increases in volume as well as product mix which were partially offset by higher freight related charges and expedite premiums total operating expenses on a gap basis were fifty four point four million dollars for quarter three of twenty twenty compared to fifty nine point five million reported in the prior quarter and sixty two point seven million for quarter three of twenty nineteen the quarter over quarter decrease was primarily related to market driven decreases in our deferred compensation expense as well as expense reductions in both r and d and s c a as a raise of our restructuring program initiated in twenty nineteen and reduced travel expenses offset by increases in some restructuring related costs the year over year decreases in operating expenses we're a result of lower expenses in both r and d and sgna and lower travel related expenses partially offset by market driven increases in our deferred compensation expense and an end increase in contract services cost on a non gap basis our third quarter operating expenses were forty nine point four million compared to fifty two point three million in the prior quarter and fifty nine point four million dollars in quarter three of twenty nineteen both the non-cap quarter of a quarter and your decreases in operating expense were primarily driven as a result of our expense reduction efforts and lower travel related expenses operating income on a gap basis for the third quarter of twenty twenty was four point five million compared to an operating loss of six million in the prior quarter and an operating loss of twenty point three million reported in q3 of twenty nineteen non-cap operating income for quarter three at twenty twenty was nine point nine million compared to an operating income of one point three million in q2 of twenty twenty and an operating loss of twelve point six million in quarter three of twenty nineteen the quarter over quarter and year over year gap and non gap profitability was driven by higher sales with favorable gross margin mix and reduced operating expenses other income on a gap basis for the third quarter of twenty twenty was one point five million compared to other income of eight point four million in the prior quarter and other in income of one point nine million in quarter three of twenty nineteen our non gap other income for the quarter was nine hundred thousand dollars compared to other income of five point seven million in q2 twenty twenty and other income of two point seven million for quarter three of twenty nineteen the decreases in both gap and non gap other income as compare at the quarter over quarter or primarily market driven caused by changes in the evaluation of our investment portfolio the decrease in gap and non gap other income on a year over year basis was primary really driven by realized foreign exchange losses offset by market driven upsides and evaluation of our investment portfolio the company's tax provision for the third quarter of twenty twenty was six hundred thousand dollars of expense as compared to an expense of one point six million in the prior quarter in an expense of twenty seven point seven million dollars in the third quarter of twenty nineteen the current quarter tax expense was primarily due to profitability in our international operations as the deferred tax benefits generated by domestic operations continued to be offset by changes in our evaluation allowance the tax expense in the third quarter of last year was the result of evaluation allowance against our domestic deferred tax assets gas net income for quarter three of twenty twenty was five point five million compared to a net income of eight hundred thousand dollars in the prior quarter and a net loss of forty six point one in the third quarter of twenty nineteen non-cap net income for the third quarter of twenty twenty with seven point nine million as compared to an income of one point six million in the prior quarter and loss of two point eight million in quarter three of twenty nineteen earnings per share assuming delution on a gap basis was eleven cents per share as compared to two cents per share last quarter and a loss of ninety six cents per share in the third quarter of twenty nineteen non-cap earnings per share assuming delution for the third quarter was sixteen cents compared to an income of four cents per share in the prior quarter and a loss of six cents per share in quarter three of twenty nineteen turning to the balance sheet on the stricted cash and marketable securities totaled one hundred and thirty two point two million at quarter end after paying four point three million in dividends during the quarter for the quarter we use seven of cash from operations net trade accounts receivable was one hundred point two million dollars a quarter in resulting in a dso of sixty nine days compared to sixty seven days in the prior quarter in seventy three days at the end of the third quarter of twenty nineteen the variability in dsos quarter over quarter and year over year is mainly attributable to the timing of shipments during the court and customer mix net inventories ended the quarter at one hundred and twenty point three million compared to one hundred and six point one million in q2 of twenty twenty and one hundred and four point nine million at the end of q3 twenty nineteen the increase in our inventory for the quarter that just ended was in preparation for new product ramp ups and strategic inventory buffer purchases made to ensure supply continuity during the pandemic we believe that we are positioned to maintain adequate liquidity in the current environment looking ahead to the next quarter the possible effects of the ongoing covid nineteen pandemic the ability of component supplies to align with our customer demand the broken shift nature of our business the timing of revenue associated with large projects the variability of order patterns into the customer base in which we sell as well as the fluctuation in currency exchange rates in our international markets may cause material differences between our expectations and the actual results we expect that our fourth quarter twenty twenty revenue will be in the range of one hundred and twenty two million to one hundred and thirty two million after considering the projected sales mix we expect that our fourth quarter gross margin on a non gap basis will be in the range of forty one percent to forty two percent we also expect non-cap operating expenses for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty will be between fifty and fifty one million dollars and finally we anticipate the consolidated tax rate for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty on a non gap basis will be a benefit at a mid single digit percentage rate resulting from the expected mix of domestic and international income in the quarter we believe that the significant factors impacting revenue and earnings realize in twenty twenty will be component availability a macro spending environment for carriers and enterprises ongoing effects of the covid nineteen pandemic the variability of nix and revenue associated with project rollouts the proportion of international revenue relative to our total revenue professional services activity levels in both domestic and international markets the adoption rate of our broadband access platform potential changes in tax laws currency exchange rate movements and inventory fluctuations in our distribution channels once again additional financial information is available at ad trans investor relations webpage at www dot ad trans dot com now i'll turn the call back over to tom great thank you mike and at this point we're ready to open up for any questions people may have this time if you'd like to ask a question over the phone lines please press star then one on your telephone keypad we will pause for a moment to compile the q and a master your first question comes from line of rich valera of new and company your line is open thank you good morning um tom you mentioned that you it sounded like you mentioned you got a new tier one in q3 when you talked about your new customers just wanted to clarify is that the case and if it is can you say anything about that that win um i i did actually say that in my notes in reality we did announce a nature of one at the end of september right um which was for fiber extension and we did pick up another tier one customer within the quarter where they expanded their programs with us to include um a different variation on the technology that we had been previously awarded so but i didn't mention any of my notes got it that's helpful and then i think you also mentioned that you've made good progress with your previously announced to your ones and i guess you know those would include among others dt open reach maybe and the unnamed us tier one is there any updates you can give us on those in terms of progress and or you know revenue expectations initial revenue expectations yeah so um one of those is a break new customer for us as you're aware and um all three of them are going well um all three of them are different stages of uh lab work um we actually have received some pos from the new customer but that's associated with you know you know initial uh let's say initial lab work and you know kind of some of the software work that we're doing for them so we actually um so that actually booked in and shipped in the quarter uh but all three of 'em are going well so when we expect material revenue contributions from them to really start in the first half towards the tail end of the first half of next year got it um and then question on art off um you've talked about it being kind of a mid twenty one revenue opportunity i think some of your competitors have suggested maybe it's more of a twenty twenty two um any further clarification know on your thoughts on timing that's sort of a three q twenty one or fourteen any any thoughts on that yeah yeah and i guess i guess here again this is the different you know when does it it's one of those things that's gonna start to have a start slower um you know you have so many participants some of them have plans completely worked out some of them don't have plans that at all they've been just focusing on the building process so um i think they'll start seeing it in around the half then you'll start seeing a ramp up from there got it that's just one more um mike uh modeling question on um opex levels um if if we're looking into next year and i know you don't give guidance out there but if we're trying to think about what an op that this number looks like what's kind of a normalized t and e level any any thoughts on how much that may be add back into the model as uh as t and e gets back to you know some kind of normalized level uh we expect you know we've had a to get to about where we are right now and we expect that we're gonna hold that into next year so i wouldn't try to model any increases i think like a lot of companies everybody's rethinking the whole t and e going forward so i think your your model going in the next year should look a lot like what we're seeing at the end of this year very good thank you for that mic i'll see the floor thank you you or next question comes from <unk> of goldman sachs your line is open okay uh thanks for taking my questions this is <unk> just to start off could you could you give us some color on what you're seeing in that sort of broadband demand and actually here in the us and maybe take to hand it out that across the tier one to the er and then also how you're thinking about the first genability the next um i first a lot of activity and i i touched on the growth rates in the tier three space a lot of activity into tier threes um which is you know just separate from what's going on art off so um a lot of network upgrades we rolled out our combo card which is you know the ten gig exclusion a good pickup on a combo card um and so just a lot of activity and and i think a lot of it has got the which is end user demand you know based off of the environment that we're in people understanding the importance of good connectivity um same thing in the tier twos i think the tier twos um are finally getting past whatever financial issues they may have had and some of them have started execute and one of 'em explicitly has started executing on expansion plans um and i don't see that stopping um and i think the other one actually is kind of woken up and and getting better um and that includes not just those but some of the msos as well so i i i don't see a near term and in fact i i see people planning farther out than um a and kind of figuring out how they're gonna readjust to you know what may be a different work environment um in a lot of areas than what they had going into this pandemic and i don't think it's all pandemic revenue either i mean the the activity that's going on in the tier twos have been part of their stated plan it just got put off the tier threes have been heating up for some period of time even prior to that i mean we had solid growth in that space last year as well um and then uh the tier ones um you know we really in the us we're in the cable mso space and we're with with large carriers and uh with one of the large carriers here on the toco space in relation to con and i would say the activity there is um i would say we've seen good activity i wouldn't call it you know um earth tradering i would say it's solid um and there's a lot of that work is really trying to figure out what they're going to do into next year so i think a lot of that is just i think it will pick up there will probably be a year you know this time next year maybe a little bit earlier than that um did that answer your question it does it does thanks so much and just like a quick hold up in the goss margins and you mentioned about that while you understand product mix maybe uh could you expound a little bit like what what you are talking about what so it's it's product mix i mean at the end of the day we're selling um what i'm getting too deep into it we're selling pond you know one of the things if you step back and look at what our business has done um we've really made the transition from copper to fiber and some of fiber components that we're selling specifically when you're talking about t and stuff just have a richer mix we also have um based off of international and domestic revenue mix we have a you know a material difference in those gross margin profiles those are probably is the two biggest things that that we're driving in gross margin difference makes sense thank you okay you are that's question comes from line of pulse overstein of talent your line is open tom just a clarification of first before my question to the response to the previous question obviously or i trust non us is lower margin in the us as a general proposition but on the product piece of the revenue i apologize if you just said this the margin differential it's more favorable for your fiber base or less favorable is that is that the distinction you're making in terms of the product mix influencing the close more if you go to file in what is the key difference there on the page i would say on the i would say what's happening in the fiber space is we're selling um the mix towards o l t s is much higher got it so it's probably people say more than print exactly right got it so that's that's the key driver in the product that's probably you know i don't have him listed that's that's that's definitely in the top three all right we might have a really strong question mike i apologize go ahead mike the question i asked you every quarter in terms of longterm margin profile you obviously just had a very in margin quarter through in by book volume and the shift to lts you're guiding back to your traditional guidance in the low forties for the december quarter has there been any change in your view about longer term are you still looking know low forties plus margin profile longer term with the benefit of volume with shift to lps can that be better than that and then i've got one followup question yeah i think i would i always say low to mids somewhere right in in that range and you see variability in here remember in q1 we were pretty hot so it jumps around a lot so i tried to project this by looking at what we see but we are a booking ship business and what comes in there in a quarter is a little bit hard to test but i believe that that's forty one to forty two guidance is probably what the mix will turn out to be for the quarters i don't know i think the variability also is i think it to um maybe think about and you know we don't have you know we don't know exactly what tier threes will do next year if tier threes are strong that typically helps us because not just the the nature of what they buy but also the software can it's associated with that so that tends to drive more strength the thing that we're trying to factor in at this point in not changing the longer term guidance is there is a real potential for material international revenue upticking next year and whether or not the two or threes here in the us are gonna keep pace with that is is kind of the thing that you know we just have to look and see there's no doubt that the pressure um some of the pressure has been alleviated in places like europe because of the the the stands on um you know on some of the vendors there but you know there's still a hangover effect on all of that and the stronger that that that business is you'll tend to see a weakness in the gross margin so come to the stem you just made it some think you make a good progress into your three what percentage of total revenue works your three today uh we yeah you've we really don't break that out i'll tell you it's very you know it's material it's over let me pick an arrow it's over fifty million so but um we don't break that out one quick final question about night i know it's hard predicting the future but assuming you get the revenues you're expecting from these new tier one wins um how mike do you have any visibility at so what the margin profile is in total not asking you any specific customers but on the sure ones would that be consistent with the current margin structure would it be the word would it be a creative any sense um it would just i'm gonna talk to you about international gross margins it would probably be a little creative to international gross margins but it would be diluted to total corporate gross margins all right that's pretty well possible thank you all right and that's the mix i'm talking about you know how much does that pile that gets better over time how much is that pilot versus where what's going on with the us market and tier three thank you all right your next question comes from the line of build the of teaching capital your life your line is open now thank you a couple of different questions first of all the the two uh tier ones the one that you won and the one that with the new program that you specifically would you talk about the ramp and the timing for material revenues and um is that different than your comment about late in the first half of next year uh that you made it to a bigger comment and then the second question is can you talk through just the uh uh european country shutdowns that are happening once again here in the last few days and quite implications if any of that has for you sure let me start with the first one of course and it's um uh the the first half ramp that i was talking about was really around the previous sdx awards the three customers that we've talked about um and and really i'm talking about until there are some different dates on all of those but um we'll start saying as a combination we'll start seeing material revenue around the half of next year um as far as the new ones uh one of them before really quick but it's a it's a as far as seeing any revenue um i think it's i don't have a good sense of timing as to when that picks up at this point i think that they want to get started and they have some very our good areas and then i want to kind of see how it works um the other one is very uh specific and mike i don't recall the date on that i think it's third quarter so next year yes right and that one is big um it's a well known customer to us um they had very specific plans with very specific revenue targets associated with it um the current date is third quarter of next year i will tell you that these things tend to slip a little bit but the the what i was talking about before was really the fiber piece as far as the shutdowns i couldn't say other than you know it it it really hasn't um you know we've been operating in a relatively shut down environment ways from an end user demand and really know difference um and we haven't seen any near term changes um in in in the way that they're operating where it really affects us is when you're um trying to uh meet with customers and and really you know we're the lab activity we have going on around the world right now it tends to impact that um so far we've been able to maneuver around that i'm not aware of any material delay because of the um the quarantine city that we're in and i don't expect it but i think um especially our bigger customers even our smaller customers now i think about going on in europe um have kind of developed an environment where we can talk to their counterparts in the lab work through issues in many cases get into the systems themselves remotely and operate the way we need to operate so i'm not every once in a while you hear about a week delay here or there um and but that's that's not that frequent and the deployment is not impacted by stay at home orders oh yeah yeah no change in that and even in you know europe what we were seeing is as far as um infrastructure in especially with the new awards we're talking about real material infrastructure builds to begin with because they're really talking about building out footprint either replacing existing infrastructure that they have or expanding footprint in many cases there's been no change in those plans great thank you and if i'm gonna throw in one more question uh latin america but uh what are you seeing with your important customers uh that there um so there in the caribbean we're actually doing well we have some um strong um i don't wanna overplay this point we have some activity going on in places like brazil where they're also of course honestly you know you know the sdx maybe you know the sdx is kind of the architecture people want to go to and so there are large carriers there's not a large carrier that isn't looking at a migration towards xgs ten gig and if you're gonna do that you're gonna do that with a virtualized system like the sdx so there's activity going on there those tend to be longer term um we do have one traditional customer down there um there are still ongoing negotiations with that customer but there's no material change at this point great thank you for the time okay your next question comes from line of the hodner jar of mkm partners your line is open oh sorry i was on mute um i apologize if you've already addressed this uh but are you seeing any significant pull in of orders from your customers um no no um we we did at the beginning of the pandemic so if you think about kind of the end of q1 we saw a material increase in older activity um i think at this point in time uh i i would say that the order rate is reflecting what their demand is i don't see any real um we do on particular parts i i talked a little bit about the you know the fact that we're still having some supply issues um most predominantly with silicon but um and in those cases we may really try to nail down a forecast with them and and try to get the and reach farther out but that's that's that's really not the norm okay that's helpful uh if i look forward to next year uh with all these uh p o one dramping how should we be think about your customer concentration is most of the goods are gonna come from the question yeah so um we are adding tier one customers as well so the good news is that there will be more tier ones to kind of spread the fluctuations uh around within um but having said that we're also adding more tier one so you know you've got the that issue um we are adding tier threes and i and i use tier threes i'm really talking about alternate cares of all different types we're heading municipalities on a very fast clip um i mean we usually have an internal announcement here or something that goes out and we have a weekly update here and there's always a municipality that's being added and we're adding tier three to traditional tier three periods at a very quick clip i think i mentioned before it's thirty something on customers large percent of those were and these alternate type carriers so um so from that perspective and and by the way i mentioned our uh we had a distribution partner it was actually a uh a ten percent customer that is not typical i do believe that that will be typical going forward because i do believe and and those are all being sold those are one of our conduits to that alternate carry that municipal space tier three space um so and and and you tell us so that base is growing um now when we get into this time next year um it'll still be kind of early in the cycle of some of these wins but we get into this time next year it's really how are those tier ones comparing to the growth rate within the tier threes i have no doubt will be more diverse um but we're adding tier ones that are you know at a nice clip as well so um but we will have more customers which will help in that diversity and then one other thing i just want to add i mentioned before the tax rates on our cpe gear and our rts and some of our new wifi solutions is really cool as well which will help add that that product diversity as well it is something you are focused on that's really helpful thanks for the color on that uh you know i think one last question for me is more topical uh a big picture of you i think at and t do for me announced that they're gonna stop selling that copper based bsl service so it seems like particular shift towards fiber's ongoing and it should be you know with all the major tier ones around the world migrating towards fiber can you talk a little bit about your competitive positioning in being breaks in uh in a fiber is it similar to copper that you your previously or is it actually better uh than what you i'd love to talk about this you know one of the hangovers that we had gone through you know we've had a couple of programs really one day program that kind of that was copper base that that died and then um which causes an issue but really it was the longevity of the copper um and the honda requirements associated with that copper versus the fiber and i think this is the first quarter and i'm i'm depending on how you account it where you're really seeing fiber be clips copper within our revenue um and so to us that's a big milestone um um and it really because there's a lot of work to make that happen um so i'm i'm happy with the um the shift within the company um and if you look at the r and d spend the r and d spend is predominantly fiber based and has been for some time so i'm i'm glad to be able to see the revenue kind of mimic what it is that we've been doing internally here competitively right outward in a very good position um we have uh launched new flexibility and new capabilities in our total access five thousand uh platform product which has been in the market for a long period of time we've up graded the switching capability and we're the only well i shouldn't say the only one i've heard other people are working on one but we are shipping a combo card which is the xgs ten gig and two you know standard two and a half gig within the um same card profile um which is unique in that customer base um and getting a lot of traction cuz people don't want to have to go out and replace infrastructure they don't have to when i talk about the sdx there's just nothing else out there completely disaggregated it is the next generation system that people have been talking about for five or six years it's actually now how in the market we've actually shifted to paying customers it is what has been selected by pretty much every tier one that we have won in relationship upon and we think it is there's nothing else that'll touch it right now um there are people that are kind of trying are reacting to it um but we think we have a good headway in the r and d that we've put into it that's good i appreciate it thank you okay thank you your next question comes from line of <unk> of northland capital management your line is open good morning um got to a lot of my questions on that last one there um but i will say that uh actually nikki made the same comment this quarter which regards to you i i can believe it that's fiber requesting uh fiber equipment copper in their access business so that would seem to be well what what comment were you talking about oh i was talking about the sdx i was talking about what they were doing talking about their disaggregated solution okay i see a little competitive of intensity there yeah but that does does suggest there's an industry wide you know trend toward copper going on and so thanks for clarifying that fiber was larger this quarter i wanted to follow back up on the q3 comment you know that's just two million that's a quarterly number that you gave for the size of the two oh three doesn't okay so well you know that's interesting and it's larger than like i said we don't want to give that area okay yeah and that that would make it you know your your largest segment if you look at kind of international us tier three tier two and tier one you know by some distance actually and you're obviously seeing good growth there and you had a lot of impressive growth numbers in various segments most of which would seem to apply something on the order of kind of a i don't know thirty percent year over year decline among us tier ones or you know other parts of the business that are domestic based and you know i'm guessing that may be a function of the you know of the copper programs that you referenced but you know is that about right and what what does it take to kind of take that the new deal coming in to kind of stabilize and make that grow or how you're looking at that part of your business yeah so i don't think it's terrible i think i think if i think in tier twos and tier threes on a year over year basis we've done good i think the issue that we had last year was predominantly on a comp basis was predominantly telex and so we had a large copper-based program going on with them that was tens of millions a quarter and it just completely stopped so the the hole that you're talking about and the north american market is tamix not it's not the u s k and that was very much a copper based vector uh the eso solution that they're rolling out um i think i just answered your question is that uh yeah and part and last one for me is uh you know as you think about your potential international growth uh next year you know obviously should the tier threes continue to grow you know sixty percent maybe they could keep up with that um way to growth i assume for planning purposes you know you model some slowing in that two or three growth rate despite you know are not ramping up in some other positive drivers um just just to begin with and you know can we assume that you know from an international standpoint you know you expect international revenues to grow faster than domestic next year good that is a really good question that i i don't have an answer for you today so it it's about um the thing about the tier three is not just let me just say health carriers cuz it's broader than traditional tier three carriers but the thing about um these these carriers is a growth rate through the year has been increasing and i don't see a change in next year so you know you're gonna have two quarters of growth before these you know the the um really we have one mammoth two one in in europe that is gonna start that's gonna be all for mental and will that eclipse it now there are there are other activities going on there's um the process going on in austin area uh carriers like um orange you we announced an award with uh vodafone all of these telephonica um which is of course not just in europe but in brazil all of those have got caught places that are in place or or where they're coming towards a decision but those will carry those are really you know if you think they don't get awarded until next year they're a year away from that so the real man of new incremental piece is um a new customer force that's um deploying the sdx next year and it'll just be starting around the half so i could absolutely envision next year where um the territory is actually the clips that on a pure growth dollar basis um but i but i don't know that i i don't know that for a fact you know we'll have to get into the year and really see art off will start around the turn of the second half but you know it really for it to be material it's gonna take sometimes so you know that will just be i i don't see that as this huge kind of wave of things coming in the second half of next year i think it just starts it starts to ramp up from there that's kinda i can't really appreciate all that because healthcare yeah these old carriers are are you know they keep the momentum they have right now you know their um us could be stronger um okay so thank you very much for joining us today um i appreciate the your interest and we look forward to the call next quarter this concludes the nice conference call yeah so okay
