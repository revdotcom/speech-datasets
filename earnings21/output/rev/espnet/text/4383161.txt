the environments are still by challenging some sectors where we operate disruptions from covid nineteen has continued to a significant challenge on each individual countries demand for protein consumption as well as for the flow of global trades and generate volatility far beyond normal civil factors we maintain our strategy while continue to improve portfolio to better respond to in the video market dynamics and generate a relative increasing performance over our peers we believe this approach will give us higher and more consistent results for the me too long run and minimize the full peaks and troughs of the command of the sectors during the third quarter in the us we are continuing to see the main recovering at our fresh operations including from some sectors within food food service with more states gradually using travel and movement restrictions q s five volume has been especially strong and the meant from our customers has been outperforming the industry similar to last quarter commodity large bird reburning was also again the most challenge during q3 operational however we continue to improve our relative performance versus the industry across all business units we're continuing to adapt to the ship in channel demand by increasing our volume makes to key customer retailers in addition a large portion of our food service customers are also within the qsr segment which has further than the impact across our fresh business unit models our portfolio of differentiated products along with our customer model are giving us better installation against the volatility yeah we're also much better positioned to adjust products and channels even our presence across all board sizes from small to large we didn't do a small board and case wide segments market supply demand was against very well balanced to and q3 demand from retailers especially from our key customers was strong support and improvement performance of our keys ready business our market leadership in these categories and more differentiated product portfolio have continued to strengthen the growth of our competitive that venture versus the industry while we commit meant to our key customers strategy has been reflected in the consistency for past results the value of this approach has never been more relevant to our growth than during the current time of great uncertainty and challenges to further support the growth of key customers we are doubling our case ready capacity of our plant in minnesota by increasing the number of heads process at the plant while also raising the mix of more stable margin case ready products with this addition we also expect to increase by twenty percent of reduction of our differentiated higher attributes just bare brand products it is also supported our conversion of one plant from the commoditized large burning to a key customer csr in the small board segments the strong relationships we have with customers are giving us many opportunities to sustain our volume increase since this customer rely on us to satisfy their need for growth in addition many of our customers maintain a limited position in their respective categories as a result we are direct beneficiaries of their ability to outgrow their competition beyond driving peer growth our t customer strategy also promotes stress enhances local relationships and arrangements or margin structure in the uf prepare foods business revenue declined twenty three percent on twenty six percent less volume year over year a large part of this degrees seventy percent of the volume was reading by schools remaining close passionate set by strength in the retail demand on the other hand are merging from sales have improved twenty nine percent driven by more favorable fights and mix we continue to simplify a portfolio to move efficiencies and shift resources towards branded growth in the retail channel our program's brand sales grew fifty two percent now just their brand gain a new distribution resulting in dollar shared growth in the retail channel thirty two cold stores data at the end of august brian inventory was up two percent from the close of q2 but down one percent from the previous year like quarter inventory we were up ten percent compared to last year this is not surprising considering the mixed simplification due to ongoing label constraints scene during q3 and overall lack of worldwide financial liquidity as a result of covid nineteen at some markets we open and the pipelines are empty we are seeing some increasing like under sales during a cover and a reduction in inventory and upward movement in prices you expose to experts including calls we're up four point seven percent year over year throughout august longer meat alone was up three percent in contracts uh through con three our experts have increased by fourteen percent year over year outspace in the market china continues to be a significant growth driver and we believe the impact of ass and south east asia and now j many can provide further support to export demands have you approached the one year anniversary of china reopening to us poultry producers are presented with exactly different market landscape than a year ago china has solidified that it's one of the largest participations for poetry second only to mexico china doesn't as a significant buyer keeps diversification of our export portfolio a high priority we have added ninety five new direct clients into twenty twenty and have also continued to diversify our product and destination mix sales of non-traditional export items are up thirty percent year over year which strengthens the current margin we enter two four with ultimate as we continue to plates commodity items efficiently leverage business overall portfolio diversity and prioritize exception of customer service to meet the needs of our key customers around the world after a very challenging first half in twenty twenty our mexico operation delivered a great result in q3 and we recorded one of the strongest q3 in the company's history despite the favorable mix impacted and other operation costs relative to the same period last year more normalized economic activities and improve supply demand balance in the market our increased share of non commodity products and a very good operational performance all contributed to the results although overall demand is improving we remain agile and are continued to have a facilities by shifting production to those channels that are experienced better relatives demand the persons in mexico explained some challenge especially in the value categories due to less traffic or retail combined with a construction in the qsr volume but in begin to see some signs of improvements towards the end of the quarter and we believe the positive trend can be sustained in t q four we remain committed in low term growth and demand prospects in mexico we are continuing to invest in all the idea and premium programs brand building fresh and in prepared as well as seeing king more market sharing the modern channel which will bring more stable margins to our operations our european chicken operations delivering needed in q3 there was thirteen percent sequentially above q2 with both volumes and revenue seven percent and eighteen percent higher respectively supported by our exposure to retail and the continuous recovering food service and qsr demand in particular relative to q3 of two thousand nineteen you bits will still hire two percent despite eight percent lower volume and five percent lower avenue and evening of covid nineteen restrictions the introduction of uk government incentive direct towards food service as well as a consistent improvement with service demand within continental europe have all contributed to a better sequentially improved performance versus the prior partner so still have not yet reached prior lessons even during this challenging time we continue to be relentless in investing in as issues they believe in labor and new improvements driving better efficiencies managing our cost base and upside in cost increases to lean manufacturing techniques and capital investments around automation and process flow without sacrifices the health and the opinion of our team members which remains a product we are committed to delivering the safest work environment possible improving the quality of our products while achieving our sustainability agenda and bird welfare targets our relative performance to industry measure as the results of the last twelve months continues to show us improving and i'll pay see the average of the competition in europe for next quarter we expect further improvements coming from the food service and qsr segments as these segments adapt to this tuition in each country and remain vigilant and prepared to react and adapt in case market conditions change the performance of our nearly acquired to european poor corporations have continued to improve we need that on an upward momentum we have now been profitable on an ada basis for the last six quarters in a row with margins also increasing on a consistent basis the improvement in performance was driven by robust demand at retail partially upset by reduction in food service continuous strength in pull experts especially to china as well as the implementation of operational improvements a capture of synergies experts to china remain strong in europe a hundred percent in q3 also exports to china have double as a percentage of our total work sales and we expect demand from china to continue driving the strength and the overall overall exports in the new future all of our european fresh parts of fleets are approved to export from china so we are well positioned to benefit from those opportunities we also continue to evolve in our strategy and we will significantly increase our volumes with the name key customer in the next quarters the integration of the assets is on track to expectations over the next few years we expect a general an improve improvement to achieve a level that is competitive with leading companies with similar portfolio we have expanded our distribution capability for the newly acquired the european office through some recent wins to increase our retail exposure and strengthen our partnership with key customers we are optimistic about building upon our operation improvements by continuing to optimize our manufacturing footprint extract best in class operational excellence capitalized export of treatments of multi portfolio of channel segments and products as well as strengthening our growth business with customers to drive innovation in value added in the higher marginators we have a great team in europe dedicated to generating the best possible relative results focusing on factors within our control while ensuring protecting the safety and health of our team members whole process has been rising since august driven hired by a combination of stronger than expected expert demand and smaller than expected old crop ending stocks in the us the fda is projecting new crop ending stocks at two point seven billion bushels versus one point nine nine billion last year which includes a five hundred and fifty million bushels increase in a for the met the current corn crop is projected at fourteen point seven billion bushels the highest in four years and over one billion bushels larger than last year although corn prices have written from the lows we saw in august processes are very similar to where they were this time last year so ibm process have also risen since august even higher by larger than expected experiment primarily to china us this project in the in soybean crop at four point three billion bushes up over seven hundred million from last year despite the large increase in production the fda's projecting new crop ending stocks at two hundred and ninety million bushes the lowest level in four years the uncertainty over the science of the chinese import program is causing increasing uncertainty and volatility in the arts its market globally which prices in europe has also reason recently despite the larger than expected russian wheat crop and projected increased supply in a other major with exporters like australia a slow start to the planting season in russia and larger than expected export demand out of the us are contributed to the rise prices in the wheat market on the chicken production according to the u f d a t it was down half of a percent relative to q3 two thousand nineteen has increased liveweights did not have set head count reductions the industry continues to maintain a larger layer flock we couldn't level four point four percent above last year in line with the trends of observed in q1 xc the industry has also managed to reduce the average age of lay hands promoting a younger more efficient freedom this has allowed the industry to maintain flexibility to manage supply of eggs in the short term by enabling grow it in the long term as the demand environment improves overall the train has shown a slowing of fully placement growth which is in line with expectations given that most of the full placement increases in two thousand nineteen and early to twenty twenty which active to be supportive of new capacity that has come online over that period from q2 q3 covid nineteen related restrictions have slowly been rolled back with many businesses and restaurants opening under modified environment to protect worker and consumer health throughout this process consumers have proven highly adaptable to the new normal and have continued to modify their shopping and spending habits in response to the new normal environment this new consumer environment the retail channel as many consumers are still required to work from home and choosing to limit exposure to potentially more crowded areas as a result we tell demand for chicken like that of all proteins have remained supported throughout the quarter while food serves demands to trail below years ago level this center has driven highly adaptable and continuously move each month from the low points in april led by the tsr segments entering two four the sba expect production to be flat for the quarter on a year over year basis before in twenty twenty one in which gives the expect point production to grow point nine percent versus twenty twenty i unemployment and consumer uncertainty contribute to a food micro environment and the fallout effects of covid nineteen will impact the channels differently we expect the restriction of restaurant capacity social distancing guidelines consumer concern for individual health and the other patient of consumers to their personal economic situations to continue favor favoring the increased frequency frequency of at home meals since striking continues to be one of the most affordable and versatile proteins retail demand is likely to remain a of here a goal levels when we expect overall food service demand to remain more volatile and remain below year ago levels at least in the near term to a third ability to adapt quickly to the new environment in a positive sign from chicken industry moving from late twenty twenty to twenty twenty one our strategy is designed to adapt well to the challenging macroeconomic conditions while minimizing the impact from volatility in market conditions while we are already well balanced in terms of our both side exposure we will remain diligent in seeking opportunity to incrementally diversify our product mix and reduce the commodity portion of our portfolio by increasing the number of differentiate products to key customers or optimizing are existing operations by pursuing operational improvement targets our key customer approach is strategic and creates the basis for further accelerate growth in important categories by promoting more customized high quality innovative products to give us a clear long term sustained competitive advantage while further improving the reviewing to market situations with that platform to additional details to our financials i f c a independent quarter was higher versus a year ago as we improve the efficiencies of our expenses but increase support for expanding the just their brand nationally and the investment for our new prepared foods products both in us and mexico as well as the inclusion of the new assets in europe also including in the that <unk> is our fifty million dollars contribution to the hometown strong initiative and the dj agreement we will continue to prioritize our capital spending plan this year to optimize our product mix that is aimed at improving our ability to supply innovative less commoditized products and strengthening partnerships with key customers even during this uncertainty times while we continue continue to evaluate all capex

our prepared remarks please open the call for questions thank you we will now begin the question and also questions in the interest of allowing equal access we request that you limit your questions to two then rejoin the queue for any follow-up to ask a question you may press start and one on your transfer phone if you are using a speaker phone please speak up your handset before pressing the key to minimize background no is to withdraw your question please press star sent to at this time we'll just move entirely to assemble our answer this first question is from benton entire we can please please go ahead hi good morning uh <unk> incident <unk> on behalf of <unk> uh my questions regarding covid nineteen uh how is your current level of absentees and plants how has that evolved in recent weeks considering the continuously high number of cases in the us and also if you can provide uh some of uh a kind of a wrong rate of protective measures related to covid nineteen during the quarter and what do you see going forward thanks yeah thank you and uh good morning first as we fake this uh global coronavirus pandemic we have been guided by three principles uh an uncompromised commitment to the safety of our team members second recognizing and embracing a responsibility to provide quality food for the country and of course in endeavoring to provide continuing employment opportunities and benefits to our team members during a time from president economic field so the direct costs that we are uh are related to the extra cleaning and in our production in common areas we are also providing the p p e including the masks and features to all of our team members and we install physical barriers in our production area and of course we are maintaining social distancing whenever whatever areas we can we'll do more than ten thousand barriers within the first thirty days of the pandemic and we continue to upgrade to barriers we also installed that dual technology will be and by coronary i organization in every plant to future the air and neutralized potential viruses as i mentioned we are offering free live health online services for all of our team members that allow for virtual doctor visits at zero costs and above all city guidelines we remove the vulnerable team members from facilities with food pay and benefits during community outbreak and that is creating some challenges to operations because by removing those people we have less people at our plants yeah it the situation is very clear it varies from plant to plant but over the last um months we have increased our staffing to close to the levels that we were before covid so we are already running a much better mix that we were during the q2 and we are seeing a very good increase in uh our upcentives levels uh as people are more familiar with what we are doing as we are gaining the trust of the entire communities people are uh less uh uh reluctant to return to work and with that we've been uh uh improving our ability to execute the optimal mix of course we're also working with our key customers to simplify our mix to create a more optimal for print and with the free print communication with uh with them uh we are ensuring their team members uh we expect to return to the optimal operation uh in this quarter perfect thanks so i'm calling with some results the next question is from ken <unk> with bank of montreal please go ahead good morning everyone morning kim uh just two questions one is as you mix as you change your mix what is what was the mix between big small and medium say last year and then what do you think it's gonna be now and then what do you think it's gonna be in about a year from now as you adjust your your product mixes yeah and we are well balanced between uh small boats uh three pack and large parts deploying um what we are doing is uh as the as the demand has been shifting to more retail we've been shifting shifting our operations also with the growth of qsr with also adapt to those conditions what we are doing for twenty twenty one is to first move that plan from big burning to small burning which will increase our presence in that segment we are also doubling the capacity in our minnesota plant uh to um comply comply or support the growth of our key customers and our just their brand which has double the sales in the online channel over this quarter looking into overall portfolio we move from forty six percent of our total the sales in retail to around fifty one percent just in twenty twenty with small changes in our operation for next year expect uh two percent increase in that portfolio to the retail and once a two percent increase in the small part with those two conversions great my next question is can you talk about the sustainability of the mexican margins you know particularly i did see that there was a a little bit of a fx benefit how do you think about the mexican operation i think you did say that it's gonna it's still continuing the momentum of the fourth quarter and then how do you think about it for two thousand twenty one how do we frame it in our minds yeah sure can and we've in talking about mexico over the last years that they are very volatile quarter over quarter but they're more stable if you take a longer period of time or within a year what happened in the first quarter or the first semester in mexico was a completing by student supply and demand so the industry increased supply during the first semester and at the same time demand because of the covid nineteen uh really uh create a challenging environment as you remember in mexico there was no um support from the government with the covid nineteen like we had in us in europe there's no governmental stimulus or unemployment benefits we created a sharp slow down and we in the region which really affected the the the demand both in the food service and retail while in the us we saw an increasing retail compensating at least partially the shutdown in food service that they it happened in in mexico and that's why the supply and demand was completely off balance as the industry adapted their supply uh for the q3 and we approvements uh adapted to that situation uh well we reduce our costs and we also cut production the supply demand improved a lot and we saw the rebound in the food service in demand in q3 and now we have very stable prices during this time in mexico we expect this to continue during q4 q4 has always been a stronger quarter for mexico with the facilities we don't know at which point that will be reduced because of the with restrictions we're seeing some increase in cases in mexico so there could be some more restrictions in in the q4 but even with the client in that situation that we are right now the results are are sustainable now all q1 we expect uh the industry to increase production to uh equate uh supply and demand and we currently more normal levels mexico is really volatile quarter over quarter again but we expect uh to be very stable uh year over year of course our strategy is supportive of the growth to increase the higher margin differentiate products as well we saw a little bit of uh impact in the prepared foods uh especially on the more affordable pro what's doing q1 but we continue to invest and uh highly differentiated that given products continue to sell really well longer term despite the volatility mexico is a growing economy and as the population increase their disposable income it leads to growth including consumption great i really appreciate that answer thank you okay the next question is from ben ben venue with <unk> please go ahead hey good morning and again i wanna ask um you touched on it in your opening comments with asf in china and in germany i wanna ask on germany more specifically i would think that's a nice spoon for the two of business just to curious on what you're seeing in that business both as it relates to the impact on the domestic market and then an uptick in potential demand from that market as well and how you think you're positioned to capture that benefit yeah thank you and the operations in europe are more focus on the retail so we produce uh most of our products in uk for the retail uk market and because of the high welfare we command the premium in that region the big competition uh as you as you refer is on the food service uh sector of imported products from poland and germany mainly and spain on the work side um as the germans uh had these issues with their production and because of the ban in china it actually increases the sales in the uk market it also creates the opportunity for our uk products to be sold into china so what we saw is that on the uh what we call fifth quarter products a significant increase in pricing but on the normal products like lines and and others we see the prices more stable because it's a zero sum game at the end of the day so uh it increases the opportunity to china so that was uh uh welcome i think our sales have like we mentioned have double during two three and we're seeing some some very stable pricing but it also increased the competition in the foods of the segments in the uk okay great my second question is related to grain and apologies if i missed this in your opening comment i did hear your overview of the market could you talk about how your position relative to the market you know are you more hand in mouth at the moment do you have any basis secured any color you could offer there on how you're positioned um you know through the balance of fourth quarter and into next year would be helpful hey dan this is joe thank you for a question obviously we've seen prices of corn and so have been no increase in the last few months which has been which has been the result of a few factors for porn we've seen a reduction from the supply side with u s d a reporting six million fewer planet acres than they originally estimate back in march delta solar final stocks for twenty nineteen end up being two hundred million bush of less than was expected when the final counting was found on the current crop we actually for the acres that are planted to see pretty good yields above turn line yield so it's not an issue on this supply side in terms of vs production but on the demand side we've also seen much bigger exports at demand primarily driven by china still the u of c h projecting a carrier out carry out of around two point one billion bushels and that includes a thirty percent increase in that sports demand from last year so even if i sport demand ends up higher than what u s t is projecting corn stock should still be in line with previous years on soybeans u s t is projecting a two hundred ninety million bushel carry out which would be the lowest carry out in five years this project that includes a thirty one percent increase in export demand driven by china in addition to increase export demand argentina which is one of the world's largest soul seed exporting countries is in the midst of historic economic crisis which is causing farmers there to hold back the available supplies from the market adding more pressure to the us to meet this demand we believe the market is likely to feel anxious about us soybean supplies until there's a resolution to this currency situation in argentina or in south american supplies can be available to meet this demand in terms of how our physicians we've always said that our hedging strategy is adaptive to the market conditions and the risk we see and we feel very comfortable with where we are in corn and soy we do recognize the risk to soybean supplies in the us and our positions are like that okay awesome thanks and that's a lot thank you again as a reminder if you have a question just press star nine one the next question is from michael pekin with cleveland research please go ahead yeah hi good morning i just wanted to touch base a little bit more in terms of uh you know the move i guess uh you know into retail and you know some of that big bird product is that um being chopped up and put into trays and you know how is that impacting you know some of the margins on the commodity business yes mike um there's a lot of products from big birds uh especially during uh promotional season seasonality during the summer that from the big birds end up being put in the trade to be sold in the retailers we continue to do that i think the the challenge to the industry is that uh we need to have the labor available and the facilities available to do more of that and that's why the industry has not increased uh more the production to the trade back as we as we want or i as the demand continues to grow it's also because of that that we are increasing the capacity in our minnesota flight so as of today yes we are buying bigger meat and we continue to put it on on a tray especially doing that and i think the whole industry is doing that okay great and then my second question is you know just looking at the uh you mentioned that your absentee rates are starting to go down and you're starting to get back to your normal mix um in terms of some the bones dark meat do you are you starting to uh return that uh you know historic levels and what could that mean uh for the lead quarter prices which is seeing you know the most pressure cannot help or is it you know the fact that china is taking more work and that helps with like quarters that are well i haven't like quarter prices moved if there's more the bones uh dark potentially being produced and you know it seems like you know the at the very least trying to take a more us four yeah you're right mike um because of the i think is and also the food service industry in us uh the industry produce three percent more like quarters uh in july and august than the same period last year despite a lower total reduction that put a lot of pressure in the lack of pricing um as we are seeing more the reopening of the food service and as we are seeing the absentees and the staffing of our plants increasing uh for us and for the whole industry we are seeing more uh the boeing we're um already at levels comparable to last year in terms of the boeing which will reduce the pressure in the lead quarters of course uh china has been also more active in the lead quarter market to the last month and we're seeing that in the black quarter inventory that was up on a on a sequentially basis up to august but we are seeing a reduction and also the inventory today is down nine percent and compared to the peak q1 average that we have so those two factors can contribute to the reduction in the like quarter production which is a commodity uh item as you mentioned and the china interest i think we saw over the last uh weeks although not today the increase in the oil prices and the reduction in the in the dollar which increase the availability of dollars from the uh uh developing countries which also increases the demand for black corporates so what could help on the black quarters going forward is both on supply and demand on suppliers exactly what you said last like quarters because of the improvement in labor and the more sales in the domestic market on the food service and on the demand because of low prices and because of more available in communities in the developing economies the next question is from peter galbo with bank of america please go ahead hey guys good morning thanks for the again the question um you know i'm just as i'm thinking about it you know the the the small burden retail channels obviously has been tremendously profitable um for you guys during you know this time period um and you know with the plant conversion link but you know with with a lot of the big bird remaining you know in the cutoff you have your remaining under such pressure just at what point does it make sense to start talking about converting another plant um whether that's to retail or or just small bird because it just it just seems like that big bird portion is is not going to improve without more capacity either being converted or taking out of the market you know in some capacity sure thank you <unk> i think the decision to go or the plan is a more long term decision and we always make those decisions uh combined with our key customer strategy as we see the demand of these key customers growing uh we take action in our portfolio so and that makes a lot of sense for us to do that conversion right now from that uh from that operation from big bird to small bird to support this growth i think again you need to look into a more broader long term perspective if we continue to expect the food service sector to rebound if you look at the food service sector today the food service restaurants are now thirteen percent year over year and that is impacting the big pardoning for sure while the qfrs are up nine percent as we go to a more normal operations as we see maybe the development of vaccines we don't know when that's gonna happen or we see more openings of the restaurants we expected food service restaurants especially on the full service to regain some market share that they're not operating today so i think it's a long term decision and it's also a very a difficult decision to move from big bird to a smaller because we have the growers and we have the females it's all built to that specific bird our plants in the united states are really customized to that specific segment so any conversion it really requires significant capital and requires some significant changes in the overall supply chain both starting from the growers or feed meals and a field operations so it's a it's a high capital investment that it needs to be supported in for the long run so that's why we don't see a lot of conversions uh in our industry of course it's this um situation continue for for a longer period of time you can see some conversions i think also it's important to know that some other players don't have the customer relationships that we have and moving from the to the small board or to the keys ready require a customer and a key customer to support and since they don't have those relationships it's harder for them to do some conversions got it no that's that's that's helpful um and then maybe just to follow up you know given where the balance sheet is now and something something you talked about in your prepared remarks um you know how should we think about m and a essential maybe from a geographic perspective or does it make sense to get bigger in in pork in in europe and you know going into twenty twenty one uh just any help there and then and then maybe you can also comment on any updates on your uh cfo search thanks very much sure in terms of strategy i think our strategy continues to say and our group strategy continues in fact as i mentioned we have a very strong balance sheet we look into increasing our prepared food operation and our branded operation to uh to to create a more balanced portfolio and we are also looking for chicken assets where we can extract uh more value from operational efficiencies um we are seeing targets uh both in the us and outside the us geograph called diversification and to growth in europe and we will evaluate all alternatives to our evaluation standards in terms of the cfo we are um in the process of uh uh finding and other cfo we already engage uh uh recruiting firms and we should have uh some some news in the near future great thanks very much guys good the next question is from adam <unk> with <unk> faxing crew please go ahead uh yeah thank you good morning everyone good morning hi so maybe first just a clarification or a little more detail um the experience of the minnesota plant for for case ready and the conversion of the texas plant smallbird from big bird um what's the net impact on your production volume um and what's the capital cost of those projects yeah in terms of total volume i think we should be just a little bit up we expect to be to grow in line with the u s d expectations and the industry for twenty twenty one which is another with lower than one percent yes as we have more birds in minnesota but we also reduce the weight in our operation on the big bird that we are just from into a small bird so we expect to be for twenty twenty on in line with with those two in terms of investments it's not uh very significant to our total capex um as the conversion of the smaller plant it's it's not uh it's a conversion of course that tsr requires uh some dsi which is portional equipment and some variation equipment and we're gonna invest in automation in that plant as well today is a manual deploying operation we're gonna invest in the automated automated the body so the investment is close to twenty to twenty five million dollars in that operation and in the um in the case of the case value operation is close to seventy million so overall you is a total of a hundred million dollars that we could invest in those two conversions okay that's a tough call there and then the follow-up was um i just wanna make sure i heard something right from the paragraph marks you talked about the prepared food business in the us declining uh twenty six percent i think is what i heard um and maybe hoping to just to expand it on that that's the business that i think i said a bit more challenges over the years and just is do we is it really just a question you know returns to school and and food service traffic or how do we think about that business or a margin profile moving forward yeah then uh that's exactly it uh we in our prepared food business we have a show brand which is the peer brand that is meaning a food service brand we also are very strong in the school with our gold kids brand both those segments are the ones that are more most affected by the covid nineteen the non commercial food service that includes schools were down sixty six percent at q2 and now they're down forty three percent we are seeing some school reopens which could help but it's a segment that is still down forty percent on what we call the commercial food service which is the street business where our peer brand is a is a leading branding wings and in chunks we saw that at in q2 the uh end up thirty six percent lower than the prior year but they're rebounding and then today they're close to four percent lower than the same period last last year so the food service business has been recovering and with that our peer uh brand has uh recovered and our volumes but the school system is still close to forty percent lower than the prior year and that's why we're investing in more retail branded business as we mentioned our uh um europeans brand has increased more than thirty percent and we have been very successfully expanding the just bear brand on the fresh category whereas we very successful on on the online segment and also on the on the higher attributes second in our uh key customers should be prepared for the segment all right great that's uh that's helpful color i'll pass it on thank you thank you your honor the next question come from like i said that with jp morgan please go ahead hi my questions regarding your leverage um the three times target how comfortable or how high would you be comfortable taking that in the event of additional m and a and are you think any um more m and a opportunities just given the volatility in worldwide protein markets yeah thank you carla we we set this progress of two to three times because it's uh it's the best couple those structures that can protect and reduce our interest payments while not creating any any problem for our bonds and for our our leverage um the two to three times is a normal operating of course during some acquisition if we have a great plan on how to reduce that back we can go further i don't think there is a number that uh it's specific uh or on where we go i think it's more about what is the plan to do leverage and of course the plan to do leverage could include uh the issue of stock and that's why business as a public trader company has that opportunity to use the stock as a currency not increase the leverage uh two points uh where we don't think it is student in the case of a significant acquisition that would be transformational for the company okay and just one last one no in terms sorry in terms of m and a yes we are seeing more targets of course the the whole situation about traveling has uh created some challenges in terms of uh seeing and visiting assets but uh we are seeing uh some targets that are still uh very interesting to us and could create a lot of value for our shareholders okay great and then just in the event that jbs is able to list the us to exist would that cause any need for changing your structure yeah we don't believe so i think dbs has said many times that they're they continue to support um payments to be publicly traded company and just as i mentioned it is a great way for us to uh to keep our growth which use the equity as a currency in the case of a very important transformational event for purpose okay thank you once again if you have a question please press start and one on your telephone gentleman there
