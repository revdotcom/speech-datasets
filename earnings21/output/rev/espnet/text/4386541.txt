continue to deliver against the goals we established at the start of the pandemic crisis maximizing revenue offsetting the viruses impact to rigorous cost manage and liquidity enhancement and ensuring that we emerge from the pandemic well positioned for longterm success to those ends we grew revenue sequentially each month in the quarter with september finishing thirty five percent higher than in we executed on our expense reduction plan realizing over twenty five million of fixed cost savings in the quarter with the expectation of delivering more than eighty five million in two thousand twenty we generated positive ebita and can cash from operations for the quarter bringing year to date free cash flow excluding m and a and the abl draw to over forty five million would be strengthen our balance sheet significantly completing the initial closing of our tower family spec transaction finishing the quarter with over three hundred fifty million of cash a substantial portion of which will be dedicated to reinvestment and or additional that pay down while the environment remains uncertain we now have the resource and flexibility to respond to opportunities that might arise from the disruption and invest in areas that will drive growth while continuing to improve our balance sheet virtually all metrics our third quarter results represented a significant an improvement from q2 same station revenue finished down twenty nine percent year over year but as i mentioned improves sequentially each month in terms of total dollars in the spot market which is arguably the best indicator of the overall health of the core radio business we saw year over year improvement each month both inclusive and exclusive of political dollars like last quarter our diary markets which were less affected by the pandemic shutdowns outperformed our epm markets political as you might expect was clearly very strong as our footprint overlap nicely with swings dates we had five point eight million of political revenue in the quarter which was a new high watermark for a third quarter and had that from that spending pace through the election government spending also contributed positively in the quarter and while still negative versus last year financial general services and professional services also outperformed other categories digital as a whole posted another quarter of growth while streaming and local digital marketing services remain pressured in the difficult macro comment podcasting more than offset those declines up nearly fifty percent in the quarter podcast search casting delivered record quarterly revenue reflecting our particularly strong newstalk portfolio and our highest ever download count over a hundred and two million in september of forty seven percent year over year also in the core we launched the new marketplace minute a short form three times a day briefing but highlights the most important stories about money business economy developed in partnership with american public media the marketplace minute is distributed across smart speakers broadcasting and podcasting marketing the first time any public media company has partnered with a commercial audio company to extend its reach the minute marketplace minute also serves as a great example of our effective use of partnerships to create exciting new content for podcast audiences on the expense front we mentioned last quarter that we were targeting approximately eighty five million of fixed cost reductions for the year including permanent reductions on an annual run rate of thirty six million more than twenty five million of these six cost savings were achieved in q3 and we anticipate realizing more than fifteen million in q4 many of these savings resulted from difficult decisions mandated by the pandemic induced rather declines however others reflected changes in the way we expect to conduct our business in the future informed by new ways of operating developed during the pandemic and or developed to meet our evolving business needs for example we consolidated some sales management and are in the process of centralizing our sales marketing research and insights efforts into one group that services the entire organization as opposed to the more fragmented ad channel configuration is previous same place lastly we continue to find new ways to streamline business processes particularly in non-revenue producing functions with the benefit of these cost takeouts and tight working capital management we deliver heard positive free cash flow for the second straight quarter during the pandemic we further added to our cash position with proceeds from the initial closing of our tower sale lease back transactions which brought our quarterly uh quarter end cash balance to more than three hundred fifty million these significant cash reserves not only provide a security with which to navigate the unpredictability of the months ahead but also the capability and flexibility to act on a creative opportunities it may come our way looking ahead as we move into the fourth quarter we continue to see positive momentum in bookings driven largely by political but also reflecting underlying improvement across all revenue streams current pacing is down in the mid teens versus last year with political providing about a four hundred fifty basis point benefit we remain guarded about the finish to the year given the recent acceleration of coronavirus infections across the country potential shutdown measures and reaction to that and the generally uncertain macro environment so for the remainder of the fourth quarter and likely well into two thousand twenty one while we hope for continued improvement our performance will remain highly sensitive to the shape and pace of external events however it goes without saying that we remain unrelentingly disciplined and focused on continuing to re-engineer the business to maximize revenue and reduce our costs that said given our liquidity position more efficient expense profile and growth initiatives we feel comfortable about our ability to not only stay the course but capitalize on the rebounding economy where and when and with that i'll turn the call over to frank right thank you i will start by providing some more detail on the third quarter speaking on the same station basis and follow that with some additional color on non-operating items in q3 total revenue was a hundred ninety six point four million down twenty nine point four percent from q3 two thousand nineteen an increase of thirty four point five percent over q2 total revenue as mary noted on a monthly basis we saw a total revenue improvement as a quarter progressed with september revenue thirty five percent higher than june spot the network markets performed comparably in the quarter down in the low thirties verse two thousand nineteen with digital slightly offsetting those results up two percent given by our podcasting business which is up nearly fifty percent on an entirely organic basis digital dollars represented over ten percent of revenue in the quarter political span accelerated as a quarter went on finishing at five point eight million versus one point seven million in q3 two thousand nineteen and three point six million in q3 two thousand eighteen of note this was a record quarter for political and we're on track for another record quarter in q4 moving down to p and l expenses to conduct forty two million or nineteen percent tripping by both reductions and barrier a cost related to the revenue declines and active fixed cost reductions as murder mentioned we continue to expect to realize more than eighty five million benefits in total this year from our fixed cost actions to date so these more than twenty five million were achieved in q3 and more than fifteen million will be achieved in q4 broken down between temporary and permanent effects about nineteen million of the eighty five million relate to permanent actions which have an annualized expense benefit of approximately thirty six million the amount of the temporary cost that will return over time will largely depend on revenue recovery in two thousand twenty one putting revenues and expenses together for the quarter ebitda is a twenty point four million normalizing for m and a activity we went again to our cash balance by three point five million in the quarter bringing total free cash flow generation year to date including m and a and the a b l draw to more than forty five million achieving this outcome despite the pandemic is a result of positive ebitda generation rigorous management of working capital and reduce capex the as we said on our last call we cut our two thousand two thousand twenty capex spent projection to seventeen million and with four million spent in q3 we are intracted to look at that our cash tax this year have also been maturely reduced from the combination of lower operating performance and cares act benefits so in q3 we received approximately two point five million of tax refunds related to taxes paid in two thousand nineteen i would also note that in q4 working capital requirements coming from increased revenues our december bond interest payment in those small and estimated tax payment related to the gain on the tire sale will cause us to burn some portion of the free cash flow generation year to date we were pleased to announce about a month ago the initial closing of the tower transaction which provided a cash flow of two hundred two point three million under our debt agreements sixty four million the net proceeds from the assets being sold and not least that are required to pay down debt program subject to a twelve monthly investment right ninety six million of the proceeds from assets being sold at least back were required to pay down debt immediately as such concurrent with the closing we paid down forty nine million of the term loan at par and on monday october fifth we launched a tender offer for forty seven point two million of senior secured bonds at par the tender offer was successfully completed on november third we do expect to have subsequent closings for the remaining proceeds in the power transaction by the end of the first half of two thousand twenty one additionally for tax purposes the gain on the transaction will largely be offset by anticipated net operating losses this year net debt now has been reduced by more than three hundred thirty million since the beginning of the year and by more than five hundred eighty five million or forty six percent since a quarter that we emerged in bankruptcy as a reminder we do not have financial maintenance government's either a term loan or bonds and we do not mature until two thousand twenty six as mentioned on previous calls we're also still working through the potential monetization of the valuable price of property in nashville and we hope to into market what's commercial real estate activity approaches more typical levels lastly i wanted to note some new disclosure or thank you related to the ncaa based on the cancellation of march madness in two thousand twenty we believe the rights the two thousand twenty season are not payable to ncaa the ncaa however chose to terminate the contract based on non-payment of those fees on september twenty eighth two thousand twenty we and the ncaa belay file competing lawsuits with or to the disputes surrounding the agreement while it is always enforced for contract disputes to escalate to litigation and litigation can be unpredictable we believe in the merits of our position at the stage we are unable to reasonably estimate the impact of the absolutely litigation but we'll keep you informed as a progresses with that we can now open the line to q and a operator thank you to ask a question you will need to press store one on your telephone key pad that is store one to draw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q and a roster and your first question comes from michael pittski no no capital market thank you for taking the question um first of all i i was wondering you had mentioned that you have obviously now a large cash position it was and you indicated that you may not use all of that cash to pair down debt so i was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about uses of cash and then all so if there are m and a opportunities what you may be looking at sure hi mike um you know i i i think we characterize it as our huge cash position has put us uh in a fantastic issue to be defensive about the uncertainty that exists but as you point out also opportunistic in ways that we can use uh cash to drive value so obviously playing down debt remains a huge priority and uh we know there's a great return to use or cash that way however you know should interesting opportunities come our way we're open to considering that uh whether in radio or otherwise uh but we do recognize the high bar for expected returns and i was just wondering as you were kind of giving us um thoughts about uh q4 and and the patients there can you just kind of give us a little bit of a a color on maybe a spot versus network um what you're seeing in digital um just kind of give us a little bit more color on the uh on the individual line items uh in q4 uh hi michael it's frank uh first let me uh comment about q3 then i'll give you a little bit more color on q4 so q3 had a a very nice recovery both as spot in the network markets and as you heard in my prepared your markets they perform probably uh but i will say that in the third quarter uh the national spot improved considerably from the second quarter we get into a more uh normalized environment um in the fourth quarter um both channels are recognized were benefiting uh in the network uh from the return of the nfl uh which we're pleased with um the uh the national markets uh are stronger uh if you look at the local markets so um part of the benefits we're getting uh in the local markets clear political displaces to some extent uh some of the local business uh so the trends um at this point uh we're seeing is fairly strong but as mary talked about in the script and we're cautious uh with regard to the the pandemic and and the spread and it means to be seen how that would impact the rest of the how does the bookings look as you go into december which is outside of the political realm of you know what you may have gotten in in um in october november at this point we'll really just comment on pacing um as of the state um and you'll have more color obviously in our earnings call uh next year okay fair enough that's all i have thank you that's a reminder to ask a question you will need to press store one on your telephone key pad that is store one to draw your question press the pound or the hash key please stand by while we compile the q and a roster there are no questions at this time okay thanks everybody everybody for joining our call today thanks ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call thank you for participating you may now
