hope you and your families are meaning safe and healthy and we certainly appreciate you joining our call today on today's call would describe the progress we've made toward achieving our strategic objectives of one advancing the use of disuvia throughout the department of defense two expanding our business and large customer channels through partnerships three dedicating our internal sales team to the hospital and ambulatory surgery center settings and we or in licensing or acquiring additional products objectives one and two allow for near term growth without a significant accelerx commercial investment while objectives three and four will take a bit more time but are expected to have a significant return we've made solid progress both in the second quarter and more recently towards achieving the strategic objectives and building our foundation for growth despite the impacts from the covid nineteen pandemic this progress is highlighted by our successful milestone see approval in april that opens the door for purchases from the us army as well as our recent distribution and promotion agreement with <unk> for <unk> for the management of acute pain and adults during dental and oral surgeries now as mentioned on our last call in two q we received milestone c approval with the us arm for dusuvious placement in all of the us army sets kits and outfits or scales associate with future deployments this approval was the high taste and our internal projections with preliminary expectations and initial stocking orders from the us army scales alone will approximate thirty million dollars over the next three years we expect to know more about initial year orders for army scales in the third quarter as the department of defense is going through its budgeting process for its fiscal year that begins on october first in addition the department of defense publicly communicated a notice of intent to contract for up to twelve thousand some two hundred boxes or a hundred and twenty two thousand to show the single dose applicators which we will expect to be ordered in the third quarter of this year after the request for proposal is issued and closed now this is addition to any scale purchases which we expect will begin in the fourth quarter of this year we also anticipate the suvia to be approved on the joint deployment formulary or jade in the third quarter this approval will be another significant milestone as it expands access to the suv throughout the other branches of the military and while the us army represents approximately sixty percent of the expect the deployment opportunity there's still a sizeable market from the other military branches upon jdf approval the jdf approval also expands the opportunity for purchases throughout the network of military treatment facilities so of which have already adopted to shoot you on formulary and are using it in various treatment settings the deal of the opportunity is one strong pillar that will support the sugar sales growth which is attained with a small interest structure of just a few account managers and is therefore a profitable avenue for growth similarly we announced our exclusive promotion and distribution partnership with zimer biomat for disuvia in the dental and oral surgery space outside the hospital setting this partnership allows us to access the large dental and oral surgery market of an estimated seven and a half million annual procedures importantly without additional investments and our commercial infrastructure <unk> dental division is a leader in the dental implant space and has over two hundred fifty sales representatives with established relationships who regularly visit dental and oral surgery customers which should accelerate the suv's introduction something we could not have done or attained without an insurance partner importantly the covid restrictions in oral surgery offices have largely been lifted allowing access for sales representatives so we're very excited about the prospects of this strategic partnership as a zimmer biomat who believes the survey will provide them with a differentiated offering from which dental and all surgeons will greatly benefit the training will deserve bob matt dental sales representatives is currently being organized and it'll take time to cover the entire sales force but we expect some initial benefits from this agreement in the fourth quarter this year and we anticipate sales to pick up primarily and q1 twenty twenty one as this is the second part of our strategic pillar that supports profitable revenue growth from a large specialized market with a minimal accelerx investment look and four we see similar opportunities where customers in large specialty markets outside the hospital and ascs can be educated on the benefits of the suvia through companies that already have a presence in those spaces examples of such opportunities are plastic service procedures fertility procedures and ambulance and other emergency medical services and unlike many hospital products such as anti-infectives or critical care products distributor provides a different value proposition and that it can be broadly used across many different medically supervise settings successful partnerships in these specialty market opportunities will strengthen the second pillar and support to serious sales growth with minimal accelerx investment our existing account managers remain focused on delivering longterm value from hospital and ambulatory surgery customers these customer segments often take longer to penetrate through the lengthy review periods and complexities in p and t scheduling we were slowed by covid in the second quarter as access to hospitals and ascs was restricted by states and institutions each of which managed access differently but recently access has improved the which is the march to june timeframe and while restriction still exist we're seeing some recovery highlighted by july being our largest month of demand by end users to date during this time we've also had some excited any hospital system wins which we expect will provide some benefit in the fourth quarter if they begin to place orders after they incorporate the suv into their protocols and medical information systems one of these wins was a recent expansion to all hospitals within this after initially being approved at just one location and with use limited to general surgery after reviewing data from the initial trial use of the pseudia which illustrated both patient and economic benefits the p and t committee reconvened and approved the shooter for formulate system-wide including its associated ascs with expanding used to all settings within the hospital including the trauma service there's a perfect example of how we see the shooter being adopted the we continually hear from our physician customers about the benefits they observe in their patients with the suvia and importantly gathering the real world data it's key to demonstrating these advantages to other healthcare systems in fact we're excited that data providing evidence of these benefits will be published soon including one manuscript that was recently accepted for publication and a peer reviewed anesthesia journal the economic benefits have distributed to the hospital and the reduction in use of intravenous opioids and other medications will be evident from these upcoming publications we expect this data to have a favorable impact commercially our healthcare providers will finally irrelevant real world data to illustrate why the cvs should be used over some current standards of care as have said before they accepted some of the suvia on the formula it's an eventual adoption into protocols this process but based on the real world results some healthcare practitioners using the suvia we remain confident the suv will become a key treatment for the management acute pain and medically supervised settings again changing a standard of care takes time but we believe healthcare professionals are just now beginning to realize the benefits i'm now handing the call over to rocket to take you through the financials thank you ben we continue to remain prudent with our cash as we launched to suvia we ended the second quarter with forty three point seven million in cash and short-term investments which represents a change of nine million from the first order of twenty twenty our net cash outflow for the quarter was driven mainly by our seven point three million of cash operating expenses or combined r and d and sgna expenses excluding stock based compensation or a point four million dollars including dot com the operating expenses in the quarter included a net benefit of zero point five million for the from the receipt of a breakup fee from the toucher phase acquisition net of is incurred related to the transaction in the quarter this compared to eleven point two million of cash operating expenses in the second quarter of two thousand nineteen or twelve point five million including stock-based compensation decrease in operating expenses in the second quarter of twenty twenty was primarily due to a reduction of one point nine million dollars into severe related commercialization expenses and a one point seven million dollar reduction in personnel costs we continue to focus on investing in the areas that will have the most positive impact on the launch and remain true in our overall cash spending revenues for the second quarter of twenty twenty were two point nine million compared to zero point nine million in the second quarter of twenty nineteen approximately two point six million of the revenue recognized in the second quarter of twenty twenty was attributable to the recognition of previously deferred revenues related to our collaboration agreement with green installed our high volume packaging line that is expected to be installed and upper and our contract manufacturer early next year has been delayed due to travel restrictions from covid we hope these restrictions will be used later this year paving the way for final acceptance of the equipment which will seek significantly reduce our cost of production once commercial production is running on this line to meet the timing of volume demands from the d o d as well as commercial customers we are evaluating alternative to accelerate final acceptance tests from the equipment manufacturer looking forward to the rest of the year we are expecting an initial order from the dod as indicated in the notice of intent to contract which will be inverted to an rfp for disuvia in addition an initial stocking order for army sets kits and outfits is expected in the fourth quarter we have reduced our twenty twenty quarterly cash oper expenses which are now expected to range from eight to nine million dollars excluding stock-based compensation or nine ten million including stock-based compensation for the rest of the year finally rude main in discussions with our potential out licensing partner for disobo in europe and hope to have more report here in the coming months we are also in discussions with potential us collaboration partners around marketing and distributing the suv to other specialty markets such as plastic surgery or fertility services in the us in addition we remain in active discussions on in licensing and acquiring assets that are complementary to our existing portfolio with the potential to add significant value to the business finally we are still evaluating the timing of our xal visa nda resubmission which we delayed pending further guidance from the fda regarding a potential new opioid product approval framework we hope to have more details on these opportunities in the near future with that let me turn the call back over to then so to summarize we have successfully built two foundational pillars for further profitable growth with the d o d and with the zimmer biomed dental partnership leveraging this success while continuing our push into the hospital and asc markets as were able to demonstrate the economic and healthcare benefits of the cvia with real-world data will generate long-term value for our shareholders as you've previously heard the early feedback from the healthcare practitioner's dosing the cv is positive and we look forward to the publications about the data showcasing <unk> in the perioperative setting i'd like to open the line up for any questions you might have operator thank you and we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star and then one on your touch tone phone if you're using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star and then two at this time we will put for a moment to december our roster our first question today will come from brandon folks of canter fitzgerald please go ahead all right thanks seven questions and congratulate that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's could you just elaborate on the market opportunity for this deal um i think you talked about seven million procedures how many of those procedure procedures do you think are suitable for severe and then currently where are you seeing use in severe um any new areas during the quarter placing orders or seeing use of the product and then lastly um sorry i'm i'm i'm gonna ask the question uh even and i sort of insinuated that you were updated down the line but with the recent opioid approval um does this change your thinking until visa or what can you say at this stage thank you so i'm gonna have pam answer those questions the first one is the zimmer biomed opportunity um just in general we said about seven and a half million procedures eligible for the shooting but pam maybe of examples of what those procedures are sure yeah so third molder extractions otherwise known as with them with extractions uh dental implants um you know bone grafting there's a new number of dental and oral surgery procedures that are commonly performed by oral surgeons and dentists that use iv opioids and we're really looking to replace iv opioids in that market brandon so so answering directly your question is all of those seven and a half million procedures are addressable to severe procedures it's not all dental and oral procedures that's the estimate of what the severe can be addressing i think the second point of that question brandon if rick i was where to sue a currently to see that currently being used again i'll defer to pam she's been working with very specialists around the country sure uh to sue it's being used uh in uh ambulatory surgery settings it's being used in procedure role suites um adjacent physician's offices it's being used in emergency rooms so we're seeing a lot of disuvia use um in short term settings also uh some interesting medically supervised settings such as fertility clinics which often have to do uh painful procedures and currently use iv opioids in that setting their finding to suvia to be a very nice non-invasive alternative we also are seeing oral surgery typically as well as some e and t procedures um so again medically supervised setting covers a wide swath of medical specialties and and we're happy that they've seen the benefits of disuvia in each of those different areas pam can you so comment uh briefly on how you're seeing the cv used in the short term settings in particular for the same day surgeries and the timing of the dose and why yeah the majority of uh folks using the cv and now are giving it uh preoperative about fifteen to two twenty minutes prior to uh incision as they know it takes uh fifteen minutes to reach that sort of therapeutic concentration and uh ninety to ninety five percent of the time they're using just a single dose uh we know from our pk as well as our clinical trials that we get about three to four hours of analgesia with a single dose and in those settings that's really all they need so it's it's looking like a a very nice replacement for the iv injectable clear liquid opioids with just a single dose and i reiterate beyond what pam said we're spending our time as a company with our resources in the short term or the same day surgery settings within the hospital ascs what pam mentioned before regarding oral surgery dentals surgery use there's plastic surgery use there's fertility clinic use those other uses really help reinforce our strategy because they're large they're diffused they're not centralized our strategy to partner with others depending trade those markets exactly as we did with zimmer buying that that was component to your question brandon i think component three was <unk> and pam you can comment on that one as well as we're continuing to study the regulatory parameters yeah i think it's still early we've not really had a definitive framework from uh the fda yet on their evaluation of uh new opioid products it's unclear whether uh you know all the thirteen was approved under an old framework and sort of grandfathered in and so we're really waiting for more clarity from the fda and specifically the adapt division on uh on a specified framework to uh you know sort of evaluate new opioid submissions i think the good news in that approval is that they're clearly seeing and recognize the importance of opioids in these medically supervised settings and that continues to give us comfort moving forward brandon i hope that answered the three components of your question it does do you mind if i speak more and i apologize you just um forget something else um just in terms of the feedback you've received from uh physicians using the product um is the onset of action and duration of effects being reported in practice similar to what we saw in a clinical trial and then mark it for me i promise thank you absolutely um the the onset of action is very consistent um again the sublingual right of administration avoids the first path effect that you meaning it doesn't go to the stomach and then they have to be absorbed and and metabolized by the liver which makes it very erratic onset of why oral opioid medications don't really work quickly or that consistently um so from a sublingual onset standpoint it is very consistent and the duration of action is interesting it's actually a little bit longer um than you know our clinical trial we did not have a lot of multimodal analgesia um we are going up with of placebo you try to keep those studies quite clean so in the real world setting you know we've had reports that the duration of analgesia can even last beyond the three to four hours and it has a very nice offset tail meaning that it provides it very comfortable level of analgesia through to discharge with just that single dose yeah i think the general feedback beyond what pam said is that it's absolutely delivering on the messages we've communicated that onset the duration and as doctors have mastered their art with it bringing it forward in the short term surgeries and procedures has been the absolute key bringing it forward meaning when they dose it and they're timing the pk to the acute pain to really maximize the product and it's really allowing to use one dose which i think's been the largest surprise to all of them and and and if i could add i think one of the most remarkable things we hear about is the lack of side effects you know i mean the in the pack you the important um time to discharge is sort of a composite measure uh you have to have your adverse events under control and you also have to have your pain under control to be discharged so the the thing that i love about you know sort of time to pack you discharge is it really the way to look at both uh and safety at the same time as well as you know making sure my safety um your patients including your elderly patients don't have any cognitive impairment and that's a huge part so one of the things we're hearing back and you aids from the customers is that that preoperative dose is carrying them through the operation through the pacu many times additional medications are not required at all and they're able to discharge them more quickly because they do not have the side effects from the typical ib injectable opioids that they're often seen brandon very helpful thank you very much thank you our next question today will come from michael higgins of <unk> please go ahead uh my questions have been asking thank you our next question and today we'll come from evan <unk> of credit suites please go ahead hey guys thank you so much for taking my questions um a follow-up on the zoom requirement deal what feedback have you gotten from dentists regarding using the product in office are they comfortable storing it and kind of all the um necessary infrastructure that they would have to have by having the opioids in stock you know i know that they do use various drugs in the office but just adding another one um and then kind of you had mentioned business to any thoughts as to what you're looking for in terms of a target product profile or even more broadly speaking you know what type of patient population how should we be thinking about that thank you so much sure well really of the oral surgeons so we've never marketed it to them that we sort of received a number of inbound queries when it first was approved because they saw the obvious benefits um they we are only uh rem certifying and supply it to oral surgeons and iv sedation dentists so that means they already have approval and already have the locked c2 storage and all the necessary oxygen and medications to treat respiratory depression to opioid so these are very savvy surgeons who already know how to use iv opioids and they certainly see the advantage of a rapid onset and extended duration sublingual tablet that avoids them having to stop their procedure and re dose their iv um opioids which they typically have to do multiple times throughout a procedure so they clearly see the benefit and that's again why uh you know zoomer saw the benefit as well um they know these surgeries very well and they know the benefit they <unk> can use yeah and i i mean just to just to reiterate why why uh go with zimer and and we mentioned these other specialty markets um there are large markets but we don't have a large enough salesforce to penetrate like these partners have um as well as the relationships um that that they've built up um compared to what we have so we wanna focus on the hospital ambulatory surgery center markets um with the partners uh that are already in these we're calling them specialty markets they're they're specialty for us but not for others but with partners that are already in that space with established relationships with large sales forces and that leads into i think the second component of your question evan which was target product profile as we look at business development opportunities moving forward so for us the biggest key is efficiency meaning is the call patterns within these medically supervised settings where we currently deploy our resources we want to keep them focused where they currently are whether it's the hospital or the asc or the anesthesiologists in the office suites et cetera we want to continue to target those the actual uh therapeutic area is less relevant for us um it's more of where they are located for use of these products um account overlap is critical and we'll be opportunistic on a moving forward uh one a common themes through all that other than the efficiency is gonna be something that's very late term already on the market we're not looking for long term r and d projects okay great thank you so much guys i appreciate the color thank you all ladies and gentlemen this will conclude our question and answer session at this time i'd like to turn the conference back over to vince and goddy for any closing remarks thank you operator and thank you all for joining us today and for a continued support of accelerx we feel we're very well positioned for future growth and we look very much forward to sharing more developments as they occur so please be safe and we look forward to giving you updates as they happen best the conference is now concluded and we thank you for attending today's presentation you may now disconnect your lines
