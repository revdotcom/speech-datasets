good morning ladies and gentlemen be very welcome to the results presentation of august for the first semester of twenty twenty the results were released this morning before the opening of bell uh the uh opening bell and they're available on our website www dot in august dot es <unk> chairman of vegas will host the presentation and we expect this conference to last about twenty five minutes and then we'll open a q and a session during which we will try as always to answer any questions as well as possible thank you for your attention and now i will hand the floor to the president with <unk> good morning ladies and gentlemen thank you very much for joining us today i'm a company at this conference by chief executive officer <unk> secretary general <unk> cfo <unk> and the investor relations team and by his manager mr antonio <unk> and <unk> we are holding this meeting with masks so i do apologize if you cannot hear us correctly but i hope you can hear us and follow us correctly we have the generation holders meeting barely a month ago review the most relevant to each use on the progress of the company and which we explained how we are facing the situation stemming from the covid nineteen pandemic the conclusions are clear we've resisted well in the first phase of the pandemic and the results that we're presenting today reflect this resilience as we are at the equator of the year let me briefly remind you the objectives for the year i will also make a summary of the projects of the company in the field of decarbonization and our commitment to the energy transition and finally we'll do an overview of our dividend policy as we've been telling you since the beginning of the pandemic our priorities have been and continue to be to protect the safety health and wellbeing of our professionals and their families and to continue to provide with fuller the supply of natural gas which is an essential service for the security of our country during these troubled months in a gas has resisted well very well and this resistant has been possible because among all of things we have implemented a regular contingency plan even before the declaration of the state of emergency as i was also explained back in time when we did the results of a presentation of the first quarter this plan has been is being very efficient and thanks to implementation the gas system is operating with full normality i will not well on the security measures that we have uh imple mented in for people because i already explained them at the general shareholders meeting and also in the previous presentation of results of the first quarter but i do want to stress that we are still applying the maximum prudence in prevention with a very detailed follow up to minimize risks of contaging among our professionals at infrastructure level let me say that the spanish gas system has worked and continues to work uh normally despite the adverse conditions without incidents neither neither labor related technical operational with a hundred percent availability twenty four hours a day every day in the first half of the year with the production of the rigas plants has increased by seventeen percent compared to the first six months of last year twenty nineteen also uh in space we have unloaded a total of one hundred twenty six l and g ships that is an increase of twelve point five percent with regards to the same period of the previous year for this month of july for the total of the month of the month and twenty nineteen thirty first december we are expecting twenty four twenty one unloads the contracted capacity of natural gas storage is or also at a historical record nearly twelve thirty some kilometers of gas pipelines and compression stations have operated at full technical and commercial capacity and availability also our international subsid have worked and continue to work to guarantee the services and the energy supply in the countries in which gas operations are carried out and all of them have also implemented their respective contingents plans of which further details will be provided in the presentation this resistant has been shown in the results obtained in the first six months of this year which are are in line with what we expected and are even slightly better than our expectations let me comment rapidly the figures that are more important we've obtained profit after tax of two hundred thirty six point three million euros which is an increase of nine point four percent uh compared to the first six months of twenty nineteen mainly this is a this is a consequence of the non-recurrent financial profit uh amounting eighteen point four million euros and that is due to the exchange rate difference generated by the purchase of dollars for the acquisition of the phase two of tall grass which i already mentioned in q1 i do apologize because with the mask and the glasses i cannot it's difficult for me to speak and to continue the results of our affiliates amounted to seventy six point two million euros the negative impact of the covid effects on the regulated business total six point four million euros in the rcs we also have a highly the position and we do maintain a solid financial structure without um significant maturity uh debts uh debt maturities and twenty two and with more than eighty percent of our debt at fixed rate let me remind you that our rating agencies standard ports and fish confirm back in time the rating of nagas at tri triple b plus with a stable perspective that is in line with other similar com and european tsos as explained in the presentation of q1 the company has intensified the control plan and savings in financial operating expenses avoiding ever think that is not essential in order to maintain business continuity activity essential for the activity and employment i do apologize i have to take off my glasses or the mask because i cannot read the current situation for twenty twenty means that we have to be very cautious very cautious in future protections in the second quarter taking into account the situation of uncertainty generated by covid nineteen and in line with the international recommendation of the regulator european securities and markets authority in a gas has carried out an impairment test on its main investments that in accordance with i s thirty six this analysis has validated by an independent expert which is tough and helps the conclusion of these analysis review reviewed also by our auditor is that it's not necessary to make any correction to the value of these investments in against in <unk> balance sheet the results of these analysis allow us to consider that we do can maintain the objectives and commitments established for this year twenty twenty estimating the net profit at four hundred forty million euros also maintain our commitment to our shareholders regeneration with an increase in the dividend of five percent with respect to what was paid in twenty nineteen and i will pass on this call on this point later <unk> regarding the changes in demand and for natural gas i'm going to focus on the conventional aspect because it is the most representative of the performance of industry and consumption you know the demand for gas for electricity generation dip and other factors really such as the availability of renewable energy water gas et cetera in any case you can access permanent detailed information on these fluctuations in gas demand on the company's website to know the evolution of the demand conventional demand as i said in april at the strictest moment of confinement stood at approximately seventy six percent compared do the same period last year nineteen twenty nineteen since then a progressive recovery has occurred and today we are already around ninety two percent if we compare it with this period in twenty nineteen we hope that this recovery in demand will be consolidated slowly progressively in the second semester because this will be a good reflection of the fact of the industrial fabric of our countries also recovering in terms of international affiliate targets and these have yearly results and taking into account that the crisis caused by covid nineteen is having a global impact we have incorporated as you see detailed information on our main affiliates especially the north american company tall grass energy uh let me to remind you you are aware of that that on nineteen of april we cease to extend our investment in the company obtaining thirty point two percent of the shareholding so in this presentation and i'm not going to repeat everything you have extensive information on the per elements of the north american energy markets in these last few months like price performance demand data current situation and future project and the case of t a p the project is progressing has planned and it has already been ninety six four percent implemented it is expected to commit to ring the last water of this year yesterday a very concrete technical piece of new of t a p is that the last welding of the last pipe was occurred was was carried out in the pipeline that is linked in italy to the high pressure um grade of snam so that's a good year actually uh with respect to the south <unk> gas pipeline i update this situation the arbitration proceeding commended in icf id is following the normal calls on july nineteenth the program state filed its defense and currently our international legal advisors are working on the next steps to follow uh according to this arbitration calendar as you know in relation to peru on july fifteen ten days ago one week ago a new prime minister was appointed to improve <unk> and so real ministers were replaced including the ministry of energy and minds uh in a gas we maintain our willingness to reach an amicable agreement with the peruvian state in order to and the arbitration procedure after reviewing the main topics of that semester and um we'll discuss on our commitment on decombination decarbonization i'm sorry the european commit she has presented the communication hydrogen strategy for climate neutral europe two weeks ago which includes investment of between one hundred and eighty thousand million euros and four hundred thousand million euros in renewable hydrogen protection can city until twenty fifty the spanish government is working on the same line to have hydrogen rope maps and biogas and storage strategy in the second semester of last year uh last week the ecologic transition ministry and demographic challenge ministry launched the decarbonization and strategy at the long term and then again we have actively participating i'm sorry in proposing specific measures and prior public consultation of these work maps promoted as i was saying by the ministry of ecological trans and demographics challenge decided over by vice president <unk> in the case of um european level together with uh tsos come from nine member states we presented on july seventeen a report in brussels called european hydrogen backbone plan to develop a specific hydrogen transport infrastructure in europe according to this report which is a first reflection report on these matters existing gas infrastructures can be adapted to transport hydrogen at an affordable cost without any kind the relevant technical problem as far as specific projects in the field of hydrogen as we said in the first quarter we are working on the green crane project with other companies especially stem which aims are developing a hydrogen corridor from southern europe to the north which was presented in brazils as a candidate for a project of common european interests eating loops a series of initiatives that will be later started that will allow countries of southern europe to be positioned as benchmarks in the generation of green hydrogen these project will allow us to decarbonize more sectors to strengthen the european energy system and to position spain as a gateway for hydrogen in europe with existing storage and transport infrastructure that have already been built in addition in addition to hydrogen we are working on other specific projects to contribute to decarbonization promoting the use of l and g as fuel under specific circumstances in these area a few weeks ago the european union has announced that it will support an agas in the development of s sixteen l n g vehicle support points biogas and hydrogen within the eco net per object also a few days ago the european union granted the full amount of the subsidy requested for two specific supply l and g to ships projects bunkering in barcelona and i to serious in the south in southern spain i mentioned these specific projects because they demonstrate according to us the support of the european union for the role of lg but also other gases renewable gases in the decarbonization of transport sectors especially maritime transports in this presentation you can see the acknowledgement to the company in the field the of sustainability and i would like to highlight once again the commitment of each and every energy professional to sustainability in its protest sense i'm not going to repeat the figures that we they provide you with a results presentation in february but ncas has a plan to reduce co2 emissions with the milestones in twenty thirty twenty forty that will culminate in fifty twenty with a neutral nation of carbon zero carbon so we continue with this plan obviously and before finishing my speech i want to pass before one of our priorities which is our commitment to shareholder regulation i remind you that these times many companies were not able to face their commit pens and meet their commitment i remind you that at the general shell harvest meeting held on june thirty the payment of a complementary dividend plan was approved for twenty nineteen of zero nine six euros per share which became effective on july nine which is in line with our annual dividend commitment in twenty nineteen of one point sixty euros per share as i have men think the result of stress test and the impairment test performed by the company in this climate of great uncertainty enable us to reaffirm with the information we have now our dividend commitment for twenty to twenty of one point sixty eight euros per share which represents an increase of five percent and to maintain our announced dividend policy for twenty twenty twenty twenty six to conclude would once again in a context in which uncertainties the only certainty the company is clear about its priorities we have resisted these agitated first few months and the results that we present today our reflection of this with the data that we have today we believe that we can maintain all of our commitments for twenty twenty and we'll we'll continue to work on new future projects thank you for your attention if you have questions now please feel free to ask the team uh will endeavor to answer to them as fully as we can thank you very much thank you mr president ladies and gentlemen if you want to ask a question please dial dash one on your phone to cancel push dash two first question have yours what is a coming from <unk> have you missed that waters you have the floor good morning everyone three questions first on hydrogen the government has presented it strategy in twenty fifteen it seems clear that hydrogen should have a relevant role in the effort to decarbonize economy by twenty fifty the question for you is do you believe that the new strategy at european and spanish level for hydrogen it's a substantial change for the profile of the company is it's a game is it a game changer for ncas should ncas change its business plan as a consequence of this opportunity and the regulating and government and entities and investors should they see antigas with different eyes as a consequence of these fact that is would be a network to try sport a commodity that is going to majorly reduce the emissions second question told us in united states do you see any negative impact as a consequence of the difficult is or the possible difficulties of gas and oil of takers in united states can you give us some idea of what you see operationally because these have been very difficult months for these companies and the third question is could you give us an estimate on the gas consumption in spain for twenty twenty as a whole thank you yeah i <unk> thank you very much mr <unk> from <unk> first question yes we start with our opinion we do consider that the <unk> the transition process that all the european countries and the eu search have on the table will not be done if we don't contribute in a twofold with renewable gases something that until now had almost no weight hydrogen biogas et cetera and even decarbonization process in sub sectors where it will be difficult to electrify in lg there plays a role and i was saying a twofold because the other contribution is that we're seeing that the storage and transport infrastructures for gas in europe are very good to maintain the role of gas in the transition process not everybody considered is going to be key but also in order to serve as the basis for these hydrogen development and for renewable gases projects we're convinced about that and in the first documents issued by the european commission they state that they do believe that that the tso will play a relevant role in this field and the context that we are having with the ministry of ecological transition allow us to think that once we see all the public opinion processes are over and public consultation are over we will play a major role there and furthermore we do wanna play that role so for the time being as you've seen we're developing some minor specific projects in most of them uh we can call um uh uh proof of concept projects that is possible to produce transport a hydrogen and decarbonized and honestly i do believe that our tso role and not only ours but other the all of other countries in the coming years will change likely from being only limited to this transport and storage of natural gas tsos in europe what lead the ones with this aim in mind we'll do all this and also we will complement that role with um uh amongst all the actors and everything that has to do with hydrogen development right now and i cannot and no one can tell you specific figures and timelines this is not going to be an immediate process this is going to take time in the coming two three or four years this will develop and we will start to have well i've already told you we have already a few projects and some with the support from the ea eu but there are small projects so i think that in the coming two three four years as i was saying we will see how a general map of activity in this field will will be outlined and also we will also see a calendar and then we will have two adapt of course to the instructions issued by the government and the commission or the parliament but i can clearly tell you that annagas is willing to collaborate we've been thinking about this since quite some time we're already working on it so i conclude and i apologize for such a long answer i do believe that our role as a tso as the role of other tso will change in a positive sense in the coming years probably having new tasks to undertake second question i've got the cf cfo he's wearing glasses reading glasses and his mask and he's got the same problem he's taking out he's taking out his mask and he will answer thank you president thank you good morning have yet let me answer four relevant points that are included in presentation that the president has stressed in his presentation first we see a recovery of oil and gas prices and a recovery in the production in the relevant basins for the oil and gas transport in toll rest second transported volumes according to july figures and the perspectives other company for august and september we see that the transport will be in line with the volumes transported pre covid three as it's been explaining the presentation it's very important we uh finished the construction of the <unk> connector and the <unk> hub and this is a fundamental piece for re getting the western east section from rocky and therefore meeting the objectives of the budget maybe as a fourth point before going to the figures let me confirm that tall grass is a an asset that has behaved with limited sensitivity to the current situation of the us market that as you has been under much stress so with the information available as us today the free cash flow for total class for the year end eighteen account one hundred seventy million dollars and having invested in the <unk> connector and in <unk> it gives us a net debt uh debt ratio four point one times the payment of we expect that dividend one hundred fourteen million euros is a ratio of net debt every day ratio of around four point five four point six times this is compatible with the liquidity position of the company which is higher than one billion dollars and as the company has no relevant maturities until twenty twenty two and that is fully line with the long term model with the capex investment included as we've explained in other locations capex that becomes a beta at a multiple of six times a beta that data ratio is the one i was telling you it's important to say that the information we have now we have no changes whatsoever in the dividends announced for twenty twenty twenty six neither in the yield of the investment communicated to the market and as a summary of the description of the business of the company this is fully live with the long term model we have set when we acquired tall glass and when we shared this information with the market thank you <unk> and let me answer the third question by how your story can some as we've said with regards to industrial consumption the consumption that we call for the conventional market we touched bottom april seventy six percent of the men they compared to last year i've given you the figure of right now ninety two but if we could see the evolution of the twenty six twenty seven days of july of this year the demand a conventional demand would be at ninety three therefore from now until the year end we do think that these conventional demand might little by little this will not be on a sudden basis but it will evolve towards well normality but being cautious as we want to be we've done all our focus in budget et cetera with the idea of having a decrease of the total demand in all lines of ten percent for year a decrease of ten percent in order to be more conservative but of course we do see that the conventional demand in almost all the sectors has set for one services but in the other twelve sectors in which we divide commercially speaking this demand they are at a v shape of recovery which is quite clear and the average would be at ninety two ninety three percent so today we're much more optimistic that a few months ago when we presented the first quarter we were suffering the full impact of the decrease in the demand and we didn't we aren't even certain that we would reach rock bottom we've reached that bottom and we are not our figures of the demand that i did to say that are quite normal because like i think that last year was an exceptional year in regards to as demand and therefore comparing to last year is very strict if you can put it this way so we're optimistic with being cautious as i always say because we are living a context of a great uncertainty but i do believe that cast demand industrial gas demand and all it's by products um tankers et cetera et cetera is going is behaving well and even tankers right now tankers are above the consumption of last year okay though it's weight in the total of the industrial demand is small well i think we have replied to all the all the three questions that mr smith asked thank you next step question comes from <unk> from goldman sachs <unk> the floor good morning coming from goldman sachs it was a little bit cut off so uh three quick questions at tall grass could you elaborate on the uh gains a bit on net benefits for the first half of the year and probably you can explain what what was the evolution compared to last year the second question is there are many items and the affiliates that move around could you please is explain the difference of seventy six million for the first half but the bigger contribution of top grass for the second part the situation would be improved and hydrogen again i'm sorry to repeat that we still don't know when we will be benefiting from these investments but the european strategy clearly states that the strategy is up until twenty twenty four and then another strategy for after twenty twenty four so would it be reasonable to assume that by twenty twenty four from now to twenty twenty four we will be we will have more visibility on this topic are we going to invest more in hydrogen as a regulator it asset in spain would it be possible for us to think that this would contribute to increase dividends after twenty twenty four thank you very much okay yeah yeah thank you mr <unk> i think the two first questions will be answered by mr <unk> and i'll respond to your third question <unk> you have the floor thank you good morning alberto the contribution for equivalence for the entire years but for the purchase space a location guidance of one hundred and eighty six million years that could be divided into two part of the year seventy four million for the first part and one hundred and ten for the second half of the year we need to indicate that the contribution of software is different so the contribution for the first semester is three point eight million euro second fifty three point four million euro so the difference between these two from a business point of view is explained because the difference between the contribution of net income of tall grass for the first half and the difference with the second semester because the the first semester before the apb was twenty two million for the second will be five five five million euros this is due to the re uh creating of rex as for seeing once gm connector was implemented secondly and that that in terms of that there's no difference but there's an important adjustment produced as a result of a transfer ring us gap autograph accounts to e i r f s i r f s which is the real estate tax is paid in january and newscap is done throughout the year so for the first half the impact was negative due to the three point one million dollars difference and the second half the impact is going to be positive sixty point two million which uh which is explained by the fact of changing uh the result and moving from three point eight uh to fifty three point four so just to explain a little bit more about the a bit time i was asking about this we have an expected a bit time of eight hundred million dollars a b are three hundred million financial expenses expenses of one point one hundred and eighty one million dollars and this accounts for sixty five million multiplied by exchange rate is two hundred and fifty million dollars that i said at the beginning that wasn't that were necessary to build up all this thank you welcome alberta in terms of the third go to we think that we have to say things order them from now to the end of the year we will have that road map of renewable gas and hydrogen this is what they ecological ecology transition ministry et cetera in terms of the european union plans i don't dare giving you dates but between twenty one twenty two there's import paper launched by the commission will have been discussed thought about by stakeholders the european environment et cetera so we will have probably a bigger road map many tsos as i said before are working at the european hydrogen backbone plan and they're working together for that i think by the end of this year and up on until the end of twenty twenty two the roadmap will be clear i believe at the same time all the tcos are thinking to come up with a concrete project which will not have a high investment economic impact but these are a proof of concept purchase that will allow us to generate hydrogen practically or renewable gas how they are transported who are end users et cetera this is important all the hydrogen map should be in the framework of the energy transition plan which means that changes cannot happen upstream and the midstream without having clear in mind who are the end users it is meaningless for us to say i'm going to generate hydrogen at a specific point and who's going to consume this well i don't know obviously this is what european union and each countries trying to do meaning having things orderly implemented meaning we will be part of the chain but someone has to be at the end of the chain saying i need and i want this hydrogen for consumption so between twenty twenty twenty twenty three and probably twenty three we will be able to implement and create projects with the end users that are interested in that and companies like anagas are really into that providing you with figures as i was saying at the beginning is impossible for us to do now i hope that by the end of the year because the road map will be prepared we will have a calendar and the volume of projects in mind but in europe i think we will have to wait until twenty to twenty two at least so we can have a concrete working plan think about what happened in spain when in spain when the gas energy plan was produced this planning was discussed between twenty the year twenty and twenty and two thousand one i'm sorry in two thousand two the first concrete document our strategic plan was produced in spain at that time for gas and that plan was started to be implemented practically in two thousand and five two thousand six in a gas came up with a first strategic plan for the total development of the sale plan in march two thousand seven so between the approval in twenty two and the practical implementation five years elapsed in this specific case because authorizations were required approval were required was required et cetera in the case of richard things are going to be quicker probably but this kind of infrastructure requires a deadline which is more or less long for its implementation if some years ago if you would ask me if we would have a paper from the european union from now to twenty fifteen and saying will we have a hydrogen road map in the next month if you would've asked me this two years ago i would've said i don't know now i can tell you yes it is hard though to tell you when the project calendar will be created especially the rules of the game to know who wants hydrogen the speed of each country it is not likely for all the country to do the same time the same thing at the same time we'll have to see i don't want to elaborate on on this because i know there are more questions so thank you <unk> for your question <unk> thank you next question will be done by jose reese from <unk> you have the floor good morning i have it from bar please three questions first could you clarify impact of twelve point three million positive in the <unk> where do they come from in second quarter secondly after hearing you about talk us there is a plan for cost reduction missing i think but i understand that's a project for growth i just wanted to for you to confirm this point if you could of course and thirdly and getting back to hydrogen i wanted to know if within that group map there is an initiative of have you heard of any initiative on the side of the spanish guy minute to create a hub it is something which is quite in fashion and portugal the netherlands and the uk have already presented their initiatives thank you yeah yeah <unk> thank you very much <unk> first two questions will be reply <unk> you have the floor thank you president cause i have your gsb two impacts first and non-recurring expense in twenty nineteen as a consequence of the delay that we introducing the accounts waiting for the resolution of the arbitration to be issued in twenty twenty two instead of twenty twenty one that represent an expense this year we don't have that effect but we have a positive effect because we get closer to twenty twenty two date that we haven't changed so the addition of those two impacts are the two of million years that appear in the pnl and that's for tg the efforts in over operational expenses and efficiency are the ones that in the budget described in the previous figures i've provided thank you okay as for hydrogen is concerned yes we have presented in two different lines always with the support of the government we've already explained it explain it in the green screen and even with stem and other companies we're talking about a possible hub for the south of europe connected on the side of vegas but also on slims uh side with the north of africa so that's uh a possible hub is perfectly outlined there that could be useful of course when they were up in spain is over we will see the possibility for our country from different stances together with portugal of course will be part of this hub and at this in time let us not forget that it is very possible for the first steps to use hydrogen in the different countries within the energy transition plan most of them will have initial projects that will the internal per country it's what i was saying before we might have a place with someone or some which will be the final user users of this hydrogen and that there are countries so companies such as ours and other companies that are willing to collaborate in these projects so the idea of moving between countries walter place that's for sure we're just doing our analysis but i'm almost fully convinced that the first projects will be over if we can put it this way of a national nature per country in very specific points locations and knowing that there's an end user or end users that are there already willing to immediately receive that hydrogen or that renewable gas and i think we have been able to cover your questions thank you if there are more questions yes let's move now to the questions in english this question will come from harry we're board of bank of america please go ahead your line is open hi more morning everyone it's harry webeth from from bank of america um so three three questions from me please so firstly just um focusing on the domestic business you mentioned a a a pretty small six point four million um impact uh in the first half i wondered if you could um let us know what you think the fuller impact of um volume decline will be on regulated revenues and the domestic business and then if i remember correctly i think under the new regulation the rcs in future years out to twenty twenty six uh was actually based on the rcs uh this year if i've understood correctly so i wanted to could you confirm that that understanding is correct and would that mean if the rcs was lower this year that that would have a a knock-on effect on future years as well uh or have i misunderstood something uh there uh and then second question just on your affiliates overall i just wondered if you could remind us how what percentage of your philly income is in us dollars i believe most of it is dollarized obviously the dollars week and somewhat um over the last few weeks i'm just interested to get a reminder of how much is in dollars um and then thirdly uh i it's a it's an obligatory uh hydrogen question but uh uh a specific one i think in the in the um hydrogen backbone report uh you and the your tso colleagues quantified the total capex spend uh at a midpoint of about forty billion euros up to twenty forty if i remember correctly if i just eyeball the map that you um published in the in the slides uh today i think it's on the slide twenty six um it it looks like you are roughly somewhere around a third of the size of the network just by very approximate um guests do you think that's a fair guess at what your share of the forty billion spend uh would be any thanks yeah yeah yeah okay thank you sir for your question the two first question the cfo will give you a detailed answer thank you mr <unk> concerning cs the bridge impact is expected at twenty two million dollars and net seventeen million and for twenty one twenty six according to your question the net impact in the pnl count at the bottom line is nine million years and average per animal and concerning the contribution of affiliates for the equivalent ninety percent and five percent it's in dollars because we are talking about <unk> tsp tsp tgp <unk> and they are all dollarized as you mentioned so the percentage of the contribution of dollars to the pnl account is quite high thank you <unk> and to conclude with a hydrogen question in our background plan document investment figures are given twenty twenty or sixty billion for the entirety of europe the document we are talking about now is a fish reflection is a draft it's not a an investment detail plan but technique from a technical point of view we should bear in mind that in europe as a whole and in spain the in the gas infrastructure network is perfectly visible for it to transport hydrogen with some nuances regulatory technical questions must be so that's out in terms of the blending so the uh percentage of hydrogen can be used in one uh grid mixed with the lg this is the first phase the different countries historically have different technical stands it some strictly technical questions are related to some part of the grid where hydrogens will be used and in this at this point technical measures should be taking for compared share stations for example and investment is necessary we need to see if sections of the network will transport only hydrogen or or they transport a blended more investments probably are necessary for reaching a consumption point or a generation point but this level of detail is not been included in the plans they that are being discussed nor have them be they've been included in the national roadmaps we have a general overview of how renewable gas will be used the second point is a calendar with some um obligations that countries imposed themselves and the third step is to see what this what are the specific projects that will be developed or implemented within the road map this is where we are now uh now the investment figures given by european union have a brought martin because they reach twenty fifty so as you can see it's not easy for us to give a final figure now and uh by heart i can tell you that european union is talking about one million tons of hydrogen in twenty fifty we will have to see whether or not this figure is respected or is higher or lower and we need to see what each countries gonna do but this will be will have to be included in the energy roadmap chosen by the european union the european union have to uh least reach and agreement with generators transporters and end consumers of hydrogen or knew about gas without which transition will never happen very likely like i said both for this will come out initially from projects we are now promoting now with other companies and all these stakeholders come together taste stakeholders come together so it just does a big project in a specific region with a specific calendar in my presentation i mentioned some of them or a few of them and in the near future governments will set annual calendars for projects we could elaborate on that but i know there are more questions let's uh go to the next uh question now thank you sir for your question our next question will come from james <unk> please go ahead okay hi good morning uh thanks for taking my questions uh i had uh a couple of questions on photographs and then follow up on on hygiene uh so on photographs you gave quite clear guidance for this year which i think is assuming i heard the numbers correctly came came down to fifty six to fifty seven million of pre ppa income i was wondering whether you could give some expectations for the next year just so we can get a feel for how are some of those positives that are coming through in age two might look in in a more normal year and then the second question is uh i i was wondering what you felt the biggest risk was on tall grass in in the you had some volume expectations for the main basins that that you were in that looked broadly that volumes had come down a bit but overall would would recover a little bit particularly in in a couple of the basins and you'd start to see some some growth again um it's what it's the main risk that all prices stay low and that growth just doesn't come through and you see contracting pressure and you know within that it their particular point of oil prices that would be that would start to make you a bit more concerned if they stayed at forty or maybe they have to drop more but um appreciate there was a few sub questions within that but just an idea of what you think that they with our photographs and then they follow up on hydrogen i mean i appreciate the last answer around uncertainties around the costs and potentially maybe not having to spend that much on on the network to enable it for hydrogen is the biggest investment then if it does come through adding new parts to the pipeline network to connect our renewable clusters if that's direct the direction that we we go through is that is that the biggest in that some opportunity hygiene maybe you actually have to start to extend the network um some context might be of interest thank you yeah yeah well thank you i think that's cf so we'll answer the whole of the questions that you've uh raised with quite some detail thank you president the contribution of tall grass yes to the put into the conversation with twenty twenty will be few six million euros as we said before that will stabilize and even grow in the future at around one hundred million euros before ppa and after ppa that figure will be around sixty million with regard it's too long term risk for tall grass in the model the highest risk well not risk but my biggest milestone is meeting the capex objectives to build a bit does that we expect for twenty twenty four twenty five and twenty six in the sense maybe the current situation shows that there are projects that compete that won't evolve so we've got good opportunities within the company for now we don't have anything specific but there are good forecasts but on the other side that's the main risk for the future yes as what i was saying the investment and development plan the photographs we have and we follow is good but the negative circumstances of the north american market and the world market have represented a small a competitive advantage which is the one that the ceo and what we're talking about we were talking about together because there are new possible projects new projects that will compete well they have disappeared because of the market situation and that provides a clear advantage to the actors that are suddenly installed to just tall grass actors that have got as you very well know uh an important part of their contracts that are insured so tall grass is falling that line they have foreseen to make the most in the future of of the new opportunities that may appear with minor investments that won't be starting from scratch investments because that entails more projects of permits et cetera but they will use a very wide spread network and that which is already pretty cent in the united states they will use that and with not big investments they will be able to enter a new market so in that sense of course there is always a risk in telling these kind of projects but we do believe at the development of the activity for tall grass with the figures we have is interesting and we do rely on that leg i don't know if we've got more questions i'm told that there are no more questions yes yes yes sorry i do apologize there are more questions so let's give the floor to the next questions thank you our next question comes from olivia van <unk> from vaccine please go ahead your line is on and uh yeah good morning and and thank you very much for taking uh for taking our questions uh i just have two on my side first one is on the um on the guidance you still speak to the four hundred and forty million to four percent year one year growth uh absolutely you've done nine percent in each one maybe with some one of that might not have been expected at the start of the year and for each two you expect actually a big step from the contribution from toga so i wonder if you could indicate whether or not you would agree that the guidance seems to be part it any cautious for for this year and then the second one apologies because this is probably your your temp question on on hydrogen um but um it it it looks like by twenty thirty the biggest first part of demand will actually just be the blending of hydrogen in the transport and natural gas makes i think uh documents are talking about potential ten to twenty percent of of hydrogen being mixed in the in the total blends small for example i think has already mentioned that for them there's probably around one third of their network that would actually need upgrade um to be able to cope with um with the chemical uh and physical um implications of that level of hydrogen in the network um have you looked at the state your network and and can you give us a feel in terms of the possible needs for for replacement or upgrading of your network that might be necessary for you to be able to handle such a level of hydrogen and and could you also tell us if we see some accelerated replacements of your pipe in order for um hydrogen to be able to fuel through your network uh better uh if that should be actually booked on your side as a as a as a capex or will that actually be expanded as opex and then your current regulation okay yeah yeah <unk> okay <unk> thank you for your question first question about the guidance the cfo will give you detailed information or process information welcome thank you president olivia we keep the guidance four hundred forty million the behavior was a little better than expected but the facing the answer evolution of the market the uh forecast for the years four hundred and fourteen and we are trust enough in this uh and there's in terms of the second question the um chief executives are so it's going to dwell on them marketing you have the floor yeah we have to understand that the current network apart from the that the pipeline accepts twenty ten twenty percent of hydrogen we need understand that and to generate twenty percent of hydrogen or natural gas that is consumed in spain now as a hydrogen a great deal of investments will be necessary for the generation of this hydrogen we are far from being real now and we need to implement this in our unit and we are implementing studying that and if we think about twenty thirty five twenty forty having a hundred percent hydrogen network we will have some of the cast the pipelines that exist today but new will have to be thought about and implemented a necessary improvement for the network or the pipeline to cope with the twenty percent of hydrogen we are far from this being true thank you very much that is move on to the last question our last question will come from <unk> from city please go ahead yes hello um just most of my questions have been answered but uh i just wanted to come back on and you said something that i found similarly interesting that that you will start your investment only and when not there will be enough taker for your hydrogen potential so i wonder can you do there's an idea of the timing i mean i think that the message is that international interconnection which are not fully regulated you'll have to be contracted before you will connect on investment um then you think this would be a possibility yeah yeah <unk> <unk> let me reply there are different elements that are under the same umbrella first the investments in our networks i'm talking about and i guess but you can think about of any other tso in europe so investments will be done in will depend fully on the instructions that we may receive from the regulators for example yeah it's already been said but the use or more or less hydrogen blended with a natural gas which is something that can be done since the beginning well that depend on the technical specifications and norms that are quite sick bone this is not complex but it will be the regulators the ones that will say yes i want that in spain or in the in france or that in italy we have a higher percentage of hydrogen within the natural gas a certain amount of time they're technically speaking we perfectly know what's the investments that we have to do and very probably they will be investments that will be regulated by the regulator this as a general response then the use of hydrogen specifically for specific projects not so much to have a general blend in the grid depends on if there are off takers companies clients that want to use this hydrogen and that they can get these hydrogen to generate electricity such as fuel for their equipments or whatever these projects will have to stay from these roadmaps we're talking about in order to give an example we've got a specific project to generate transport and use hydrogen in the <unk> islands and that's a specific a project in which the ultimate offtaker will be a uh a company transporting passengers and that is a clear example that that doesn't need specific regulation and but using in the spanish grid or the french or the italian grid part of hydrogen as blended with natural gas too among other things to reduce the co2 that will require from technical regulations where we are involved of course the ministry is involved and the ministry has asked our opinion about what are the technical measures that we will have will have to be implemented in this calendar to be used renewable gases that's work and pro under process under progress but as of july we don't have more details as i was replying to a similar question before i think that by the end of this year and the end of twenty twenty one or twenty twenty two i think that this map this technical regulatory map will be fully finished in europe and in parallel we will see a specific projects appearing and thank you <unk> there are no more questions i've told so apart from the minor problems of the mask and the reading glasses i think that we've been able to reply to your questions uh we do want to thank you for the interest on the company and the relation investors relations team if you need more information will give you detailed information if you required from them thank you <unk> so we host these conference on the first semester twenty twenty results of <unk> thank you okay
