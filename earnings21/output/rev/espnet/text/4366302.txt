company's earnings press release supplemental information forms ten q and ten k are available on the company's website john thank you carla first i'd like to offer our best wishes to everyone as we approach five months since the start of the pandemic we are encouraged by the positive signs of recovery in the healthcare space and grateful for those who've worked tirelessly throughout this pandemic including our tenants and partners they have demonstrated extraordinary resilience well beyond what we anticipated we expect we will continue to contend with covid nineteen as it ebbs and flows what's encouraging is the progress of better treatments and promising vaccine developments moderna pfizer astrazeneca and many others a report positive results from fast track clinical trials many expect a successful vaccine in twenty twenty with widespread availability next year public health officials are also taking a much more target approach to addressing how spots which is allowing healthcare services to remain open across the country we are seeing physicians ramp up their volumes quickly now approaching pre covid levels they're experiencing heightened demand for delayed air providers are balancing the delivery of much needed care with safety precautions and they have gained valuable experience in treating their covid patients as a result we are not seeing the use of lengthy or widespread bands on elective procedures several publicly traded national healthcare companies including hca surgery partners and tenant have recently reported steady improvements and volumes throughout may june and july likewise we have seen tenant utilization of buildings rebound to nearly ninety percent of pre covid levels it does vary geographically somewhat from a low of seventy five percent in washington dc to a hundred percent here in nashville can it work or a request are now running at pre covid levels and leasing momentum has also rebounded tours with prospective tenants which dip below fifty percent of typical volumes in april are now running well above average rent collection stands at ninety seven percent for the second quarter as well as july new deferral requests to fall into nearly zero in the last thirty days and over half of deferrals granted during the second quarter were repaid early which is very encouraging for givable ppp loans kicked in as designed for payroll rent and utilities the healthcare sector received more than twelve percent of all ppp loans of which the biggest recipients were physician offices at more than eight point four billion dollars hr's operating results for the second quarter were steady despite the impact of covid strong cash leasing spreads high tenant retention and stable contractual rent bomb were positive signs of the resiliency of our tenants and the stability of our portfolio with tours being well off pace in april and may occupancy could be marginally softer in the second half of the year but with sharp recovery in june in july we expect occupancy to strengthen going into twenty one as a result same store wide growth will likely be closer to two percent in twenty twenty and bounce back toward three percent next year external growth is still on pace for a solid twenty twenty the pipeline is strong even after we took extra time to underwrite the financial health of tenants we've increased the top end of our acquisition guidance to be in line with our volume last year and well ahead of hers our historical average we have plenty of funding capacity from the mercy dispositions cash on hand forward equity and full availability on our line of credit we are poised to take advantage of a sizable and growing pipeline the pandemic has underscored the critical nature of healthcare services even in uncertain times it has shown that hospitals are the hub of essential care including high acuity outpatient services which draw the stability of our cash flows despite the pandemic we still expect to produce positive ffo per share growth in twenty twenty rising secular demand a strong balance sheet and a robust pipeline position as well to grow safely in the years ahead and i'll turn it over to ms mancini for some additional commentary on healthcare trends bethany thank you the healthcare sector can continues to prove its resilience and significance to the us population and economy after five months of experience with covid nineteen hospitals and physicians are now better equipped with protocols in place and adequate ppe to serve covid patients at the same time providers are managing higher demand from the delay of scheduled care second quarter employment growth numbers are showing covid's unprecedented impact on jobs in april and may with promising signs of recovery in the healthcare sector from late may into june and continued positive momentum heading into the third quarter notably the pace of recovery in the ambulatory sector including physician offices has doubled that of the broader economy healthcare providers are meeting pent up demand for elective care and the resurgence of strong utilization trends returning to more normalized levels quickly hr's tenants on average are operating your full capacity and they're better prepared to provide ongoing outpatient care even in the event of a local surge telemedicine and served a critical role in april and may for many providers the easing of its restrictions and higher reimbursements help sustain patient care and physician practice revenues during the height of the pandemic and the shutdown of non-emergent care since then physician offices in most of our markets have returned to seen a majority of patients in person the trump administration issued an executive order earlier this week to review and continue medicare's coverage of telehealth services after which cms proposed to permanently allow medicare providers to use telehealth for evaluation and management services along with visits for some mental health related care depending on rem and technology and security requirements we foresee telemedicine allowing our tenants to improve their efficiency in providing lower acuity services it could spur greater access of rural communities to irv and care centers and support providers in general as they meet rising demand for high acuity care from an aging population cms remains active on the regulatory front in pursuing several medicare cost saving initiatives these include hospital pricing transparency site neutral payments for off campus hospital based outpatient care in the addition of newly covered services in outpatient settings these initiatives incentivize care are in lower cost settings typically in medical office buildings and ambulatory surgery centers as we approach the presidential elections we can expect heated public debate over another round of federal stimulus and can covid nineteen relief for healthcare providers we believe the sector is positioned well even absent additional legislation to continue to meet the demands of responding to covid and deliver the underlying growth and healthcare services are populational need in the quarters to come the results of the election for both the presidency and congress could impact the nation's mix of health insurance coverage and expansion of medicare and medicaid regardless of election results we expect the shift of healthcare delivery will continue toward lower cost outpatient settings now i will turn it over to rob hall for an overview of investment activity rob thank you bethany healthcare realties investment activity during the quarter and be characterized as two distinct periods defense at the outset and back to offense by the end of the quarter we started on defense by shoring up liquidity with an agreement to sell two single tenant net lease properties to st louis based mercy for two hundred forty four million dollars or six hundred thirty three dollars per square foot what's also important is that this transaction represents a meaningful shift out of slower growing properties and smaller markets and into attractive growing msas with significant opportunities for future investment additionally we took a deeper dive in due diligence for acquisitions rather than terminating contracts and risk losing solid deals because of covid nineteen for example we double the length of inspection periods to monitor the health and stability of these properties we also conducted extensive tenant interviews over multiple billing cycles and we analyze rent collection and deferral record us at buildings under contract compared it to our own portfolio and it sacked up really well these critical steps allowed us to shift to offense as we approach the third quarter in july we closed on four movies for eighty three million dollars one property marks our first acquisition in the san diego market a market where we have identified substantial opportunity for future investment another in los angeles will benefit from the hospital's recent affiliation with double a minus rated cedar sinai health system which will provide an infusion of capital to increase hospital services in this dense market the last two located in atlanta and seattle represents additional investment and attractive growth markets on campuses where we own multiple property all through the quarter our team continued to use their deep industry relationships to source deals and build a pipeline even as the volume of market transactions declined we now have ten buildings under six separate contracts or letters of intent for an additional one hundred and sixty three million these targeted acquisitions are located in six markets where we already have where we already are invested we expect to close these deals by year end and along with properties closed in july will fully reinvest the two hundred forty four million dollars of mercy proceeds our renewed confidence to proceed with closings and a growing pipeline are driving the increase in our acquisition guidance up to three hundred to three hundred seventy five million for the year we expect our average cap rate to remain between five and five point eight percent the outlook for acquisitions remains positive as healthcare providers continue to experience meaningful improvement in patient visits and procedures mob rent roles are holding up allowing sellers to return to the market although a few buyers are temporarily on the sidelines cap rates are steady as investor demand is wide and deep of the stable cash flows from mobs while several sizable portfolios are available we haven't found them compelling enough to deviate from our targeted process of investing in one or two buildings at a time on the development front we are making steady progress on a thirty million dollar redevelopment project in memphis during the course of the pandemic several tenants expanded their space requirements including the surgery center and large orthopedic tenant as a result the lease percentage has moved up to ninety four percent during the first quarter of twenty twenty one we expect exterior improvements to be completed and the buildings anchor tenant to take occupancy the remainder of the suites will take occupancy throughout the second and third quarters of twenty twenty one the pandemic has delayed some development discussions but hospitals are not abandoning long-term expansion plans for example in july a leading health system in tacoma announced a three hundred million investment in a new bed tower and next week here in nashville for think thomas will break ground on its three hundred million dollar expansion we are planning redevelopments at both of these campuses and we expect to start these projects soon i am pleased with our team's ability to of the solid investment pipeline during these times their hard work will lead to time to the timely reinvestment of proceeds generated from recent sales and positions as well for creative growth in twenty twenty one now i will turn it over to chris to discuss financial and operational performance for the quarter thanks rob second quarter performance with strong is covid-related revenue impacts work offset by operating expense controls and dna reductions normalized ffo for share of forty two cents was an increase of five percent over the same period a year ago before diving into the specific i party metrics for the quarter i will touch on rent collection and deferrals we saw significant sequential improvements in may june and july this was the result of a swift rebound in patient volumes following the end of govern mandated shutdowns early in the quarter we collected over ninety nine percent of second quarter rent including two percent of deferrals these deferrals are to be paid back in the second half of the year for july deferrals were less than a hundred thousand dollars over of our over forty million and monthly rent in addition over half of deferrals granted in the second quarter were repaid early signaling how our tenants are getting back to business scheduled rent deferral payments for july are tracking well at eighty eight percent while this is promising it is early in the process so we took a seven hundred thirty thousand dollars bad debt reserve representing twenty five percent of outstanding deferrals at quarter end we will continue to monitor and analyze collections through the balance of the year and adjust reserves accordingly now shifting to operating performance trailing to twelve month same store and i grew one point nine percent which was impacted by lockdowns in the quarter and three main ways first there was an eight hundred thousand dollars sequential reduction and transient parking income parking volumes returned to approximately eighty percent of pre-pandemic levels by the end of june second six hundred seventy three thousand dollars of the total rent deferral reserve was in the same store portfolio and third and most notable was a benefit of one million from a reduction and net operating expenses due to lower building traffic in the quarter the primary reductions were in maintenance and utilities which each decline of a half a million dollars compared to the previous year as utilization in foot traffic has rebounded in june in july we expect operating expenses to return to more customary third quarter levels including typical seasonal utilities but for these three impacts trailing twelve months same store growth would've been approximately twenty basis points higher in oi growth and future periods should be reliably strong given the multi tenant leasing tricks this quarter including retention of eighty four point six percent average in place contractual increases of two point eight nine percent in cash leasing spreads of four point five percent in the quarter we have one hundred seventy nine thousand square feet of new leases take occupancy led by gains at several reposition and development properties this level of new leasing exceeded our historical average of approximately a hundred thousand square be per quarter looking forward given a slow down in leasing tours early in the second quarter due to local restrictions we could see leasing drop below our historical average in the second half of the year our same store guidance reflect the potential for this impact moving into twenty twenty one we expect leasing to increase as tours have already rebounded to pre covid nineteen levels and demand for outpatient space continues to strengthen the now shifting to liquidity and leverage our fad dividend payout ratio was eighty four percent for the quarter and ninety three percent for the trailing twelve months we expect full year twenty twenty to be in the low nineties in that debt to ebitda improve to five point one times including the issuance of thirty three million of equity through the atm in addition we entered into four equity contracts for an additional seventy four million these proceeds can be drawn at our election over the next twelve months we don't expect to draw any of the ford equity proceeds until twenty one given the substantial liquidity available to fund are growing investment pipeline our liquidity includes forty four million of cash at quarter end and two hundred forty four million from the mercy dispositions which closed last week our investment in the mercy properties result in an unlevered irr of eleven and a half percent while the reinvestment in multi-tenant mobs and major msas will improve the diversification and growth profile of our portfolio for example the contractual escalators for the mercy assets have been running one point seven percent which is more than a hundred basis points below our existing portfolio and our acquisition pipeline the cap rate rotation upon reinvest will result in a little more than three cents of annual solution the timing of the reinvestment through the third and fourth quarters will bring forward all of the three plus cents into twenty twenty however even with this solution and the covid nineteen impacts discussed earlier we anticipate positive ffo per share growth in twenty twenty and we are positioned well for continued ffo per share growth in twenty one and beyond thank you chris uh operator chuck we will be ready to open it up to the question and answer period thank you we will now begin the question and answer session to ask a question you may press star then one on your touch tone phone if you're using a speaker phone please pick up your handset before pressing the keys to withdraw your question please press star then two at this time we'll pause momentarily to assemble our roster the and our first question will come from nick joseph with city please go ahead thank you i appreciate the color on the acquisition pipeline what's the tip goal hit rates on assets that are in negotiations yeah i think if you look at the um um the pipeline a hundred sixty three million that we're looking at right now it's you know they're they're within our range um we've given the five to five a probably down in the you know low to mid fives is where on average those are gonna be um are you i guess i guess they're more curious on the a hundred yeah the a hundred twenty negotiation i mean would you expect to close on the your percent of those or what what's typically the fallout for that bucket of uh potential acquisitions yeah i mean i think if you think about the a hundred twenty we've we've said that there are some in there that we think might close by the end of the year and then and and then moving into early next i would say the cap rates in in those buildings um are in the similar range uh to what we have under contract pipeline and certainly it's early and and we're in discussions with those sellers um there are some that sometimes may fall out or take longer uh to close on but we have a good line of sight on those and uh are optimistic about the opportunities there i i would add to that maybe nick it's a little hard to obviously give you a one percentage probability but it's a range but i think you know it's not fifty fifty if that helps you it's probably you know not a hundred percent as rob just said but you know maybe it's it's seventy eighty percent at least and and the nice thing is mean those are ones that are pretty far along in discussions there's clearly a lot of other things not in that number that are a little further out there maybe not as highly probable so uh you know i think it's that number is a strong number um just in general if you think about productivity going into twenty one thanks that's helpful and then you mentioned the portfolios on the market today um you know what would make you more interested is it pricing is it something specific about the mix of assets within those uh that would be more interested than executing on those um yeah i'd say that um rather than pricing just the markets and the systems that they're uh associated with um the strength of those markets the opportunities for growth um is really a key uh piece uh that we look at and i would also say that the you know the on adjacent makeup versus versus the off makeup um typically what you see is is you know there's a number of properties a few properties in there that really will but then there's other properties in there that you really don't like and i think that's where these portfolios that are out there they kind of fall into now and and nick i think is we've looked we've looked at portfolios over the years we also recognize you you can't always find the perfect portfolio by definition and so it really comes down to is there a high enough proportion of what rob described as attractive assets that would be worth you know taking on a few of those things that that we don't like as much and so you know we've we've always struggled with that we we obviously think our portfolio reflects a lot of the quality metrics we're looking for and we wanna improve the average but you know if seventy eighty percent of the assets really fit then i think it makes some sense and you know the met is an only transaction the atlanta transaction um three years ago you know is a great example of that um you know we we certainly looked at the duke transaction hard and competed for that so you know i'd throw that in there but some others like cnl and others we you couldn't get there thank you our next question will come from sarah tan with jp morgan please go ahead hi um i'm on from mike muller this morning i just have one question could you talk about the acquisition then statement one camera looking like i'm i'm sorry i didn't hear the end of your question can you repeat that oh sorry i just to ask um could you discuss the acquisition landscape and what camry does it look like sure um i would say that pricing uh for acquisitions has remained steady um the the the cash flows and and mobs has held up remarkably well uh during this period and i think that's a testament to the security and reliability of the asset class and so you're seeing uh you know continued demand for the product um there has been a few buyers that are that are temporarily on the sidelines but we seek uh plenty of capital continuing to participate in the space and so because of that we just haven't seen any meaningful movement in cap rates the other thing rob i might add to that would be you've even seen you know really since covid a couple of transactions by well tower that are very supportive of that that you've seen cap rates sort of right in the mid fives uh for those portfolios so i think that sort of underscores that you know that five and a half range for typical um you know mobs and portfolios is very consistent over the last really couple of years and then you know occasionally you see you know deviations from that more when you get down to specific assets that may draw it towards five or less or the other way for lower quality assets thank you okay our next question we'll come from victim <unk> with morgan stanley please go ahead uh thanks for taking the question um this first one you know you had a nice uh improvement on the fact payout um and you highlighted where you think this could kind of end up you were your end i'm just wondering how sustainable that level is is there any capex kind of bump we should expect next year or do you think this level is sort of sustainable going forward and that obviously you chris i'll touch on maybe you jump in but remember we're all uh social distancing so we're we aren't as easily able to uh not talk over each other which i apologize chris but i i would say on the dividend you're exactly right victim uh chris mentioned low no inties for this year and certainly we're trying to steadily improve that so we do hope to maintain that level if not improve it each year um but you know as chris also talked about we've got a lot of leasing uh strength and as we go into the later part of this year and into next year so we do expect that what probably benefited us frankly in the second quarter and maybe even in the third would be a little less spending on ti uh because of the slow down in leasing we see that probably picking right back up later in the year and into next year so you know it's it's a little early to tell uh exactly where we'll be for twenty one but we like the direction generally where we're headed and uh we'll we'll certainly have a better sense of that as we start putting our plans to other for twenty one later this year okay great um and then just todd sorry go ahead and todd right i was only i would add to that is just the the idea that where we are in terms of our capital other than t i i don't see any a major shift there um but if we don't see the continued improvement that we have been seeing in the last several years it would be tied to that uh be tied to absorption and new leasing which is which is great um for long term in terms of of uh earnings and such but uh but could you know slow the momentum um temporarily in terms of continued driving that uh payout ratio lower but long term we're we're certainly moving in the right direction okay great and then and just um uh you know on a little bit more color on the pipeline i know in the past you've alluded to you know potentially looking a bit more at off campus um i'm just wondering through covid are there you know how has that thought process changed maybe give a sense of the pipeline mix between on and off and and also just through covid are there any other markets you're thinking about in terms of new investments or developments rob you wanna touch on maybe the current pipeline and and what that might look like on versus off and then i can i it to it yeah i think that um when you look at the at the current pipeline the majority of it is is in on on an adjacent but there are a few assets in there that that kind of fall into the on campus category uh by our definition and i think those are kind of similar what you've heard to say in the past different about strong markets um that are markets where we already have an investment uh and um you know i think that's where if we are gonna go off campus that's where you think we will be we'll do that kind of investing markets that we know i'm familiar with and investing in off campus assets that are sort of part of the provider provider network and lend itself to that relationship i would add rob that that in terms of just thinking differently you know post covid or or now we're still in covid but as we look ahead i don't see that we would make a tremendous change in the markets that we're going after i think the ones we've been working on building our presence and still look very attractive to us you know even with what's going on now um obviously like everyone we're gonna be watching all the trends we're not heavily exposed to certain markets in the northeast new york boston um you know great cities obviously but there are some some bigger tr you know challenges that that may come you know over time with with office demand and so forth um less about healthcare there but i would say we really like some of the tech um you know job uh concentration that we see in a lot of the markets we've been focused on mean two of the markets that we've added you kind of asked that question about adding markets uh we just added san diego as rob pointed out in the last year we've been adding a bit in raleigh the raleigh durham area which we like as well uh but but nearly ninety percent of what we've been doing eighty ninety percent of the activity in the last few years has been very focused on our top fifteen markets so it's a lot of activity in the same markets we've been building scale in and then occasionally reaching out like i mentioned to san diego raleigh some others like that there's probably probably four five you know other markets we'd certainly look at and see some depth in but you know it's it's we're definitely leaning towards the markets we're currently invested in great thank you thank you our next question will come from jordan sandler with key key bank capital markets please go ahead thank you um first i just wanna follow up on the the uh the pipeline i'm not sure if i'm overly reading into your commentary but it sounded like you mentioned a large and growing pipeline is there potentially more behind this or are there a handful of larger deals that you're looking at cause i'm noticing you know you've you've taken the leverage on a proforma basis quite low and i know it's a challenging environment so it doesn't make sense but uh i'm guessing proformal level with the forward equity and sale and mercy probably closer to four times just directly from wrong so i'm kind of curious what what you're you know teed up for yeah i would say on the on the pipeline jordan um you know our team is is is always building and adding to our pipeline i mean we we take the approach of you know i think if you look at what we've closed on this year about eighty percent of that is what we would consider you know offer lightly marketed deals so our team is out there constantly developing those relationships we've identified buildings that we want to own and you know we have dialogue with the sellers or or brokers in those markets that that uh we we trust and and you know are constantly trying to get those sellers to the table so we we think that behind what we've laid out here certainly there's there's more opportunity that we're working on and i think that's where we see the growth in the pipeline uh coming in setting us up well for for twenty twenty one so uh i think that's why we we have the confidence that we do because we see the dialogue that our team is having with these these sellers that are that are sort of behind what we've laid out here and jordan i i would add to that i do think i mean i think maybe what's in your question too is sort of you know are we preparing for something bigger i think it's more about i mean in some ways yes but it's not a complete change of stripes for us i think it's very much sticking to what rob just described really going after and targeting what we want rather than you know waiting on the marketed deals that said of course we we look at the marketed deals and if they measure up we certainly go after them and and it's not you know we we certainly are encouraged that um you know we would like to you know go after some some deals if we can in this situation where we we seem you know to be able to as you said have to capital the resources but you know again we're gonna probably stick to as you would know us to do stick to the quality side of things um but we're encouraged by the the productivity and the activeness that rob described of sustaining a higher level of acquisitions i think that's the key and really you know recognizing the importance of of prudent growth through external growth in addition to our internal growth to kind of work that algorithm of ffo growth for sure is the mix and i know i think there was we just we just spoke to a question of a similar thing but is the mix kind of skew continues skewed toward the adjacent type assets you think i certainly think we will we will skew towards on and adjacent um versus off but you know again we're we're okay with off i think we're all touched on that we are okay with that i would say you know today we sit closer to almost ninety percent on an adjacent um we have done a fair bit of adjacent um as you kind of point out and and sometimes you know what you find is those are the ones that you know you can go in and target and get um um you know really get those assets more regularly and you know the on campus it's tough cuz you're waiting for those hospitals to let that go typically so uh we really like the dynamic though of on an on an adjacent and and i could see you know the off fluctuating i think we've we maybe last year hit or on twenty five percent um you know off so we're okay with that it's still gonna skew that way towards on on an adjacent though okay and then lastly maybe for chris on the cap rates um um i i've got the cash cap rate here i'm kind of here you mentioned the escalators on mercy um can you give me the gap cap rate on that this position and then uh i'm just curious what the escalators and gap cap rates look on the acquisitions as well yeah on um on mercy the the gap in cash were pretty close to the same because we were about the midpoint of the of the least turn um so they're they're kind of right on top of each other um in terms of the the new acquisitions that we're that we're looking at the escalators as i mentioned are pretty similar to what our existing portfolio is called you know that two eight to two nine range um in terms of escal and uh you know it it varies on the impact of the gap uh based off of the term that's inside of our acquisitions but but in general we typically say the gap adds about twenty five to fifty basis points um uh to the to the cap rate on a gap basis uh in our acquisitions okay thanks for clarifying our next question will come from lucas heart heart rich with green street advisors please go ahead i think the room for your time this morning uh this is john on for lucas uh just a quick one for me uh looking at the improvements in your expectations for the cash releasing spreads on the multi-tenant side uh you know what's behind that optimism um obviously the year today trends are pretty favorable and just wondering if there's actually some opportunity for outside there as well thank you very much yeah if you really look at the change in our guidance on um on the cash leasing spreads we did change it this quarter compared to last but that really was just kind of bringing it back more in line with what we had seen pre covid um last quarter we were taking we didn't wanna be overly aggressive um you know not having a lot of of leasing data uh in the midst of of what was going on and so that we had taken um had taken down our expectations but as uh as we uh worked through releases during the quarter and continued our discussions um you know things have have really shown uh um great um you know resilience and so uh our expectations is that our cash leasing spreads will be able to kind of maintain what we had been seen previously um which long term we say we we expect uh three to four uh and and so we're we're so far we're seeing that those types of metrics are holding up well and our next question will come from rich anderson with smbc please go ahead thanks everybody good morning um so one thing we are not talking about is um the risk going forward of reinfection and you know certainly many of the states that you traffic in were we've seen some uptick but no no talk of sort of a reversal of you know elective surgery uh shutdowns and whatnot um can you can you discuss that a little bit about how how you're seeing that play out i mean even though the availability or or states are allowing for uh like surgeries are people really jumping in and doing it and is there a risk that you know a month or so from now we could be having another conversation about shutting it down rich i it's a very good question and i think we all sort of have that unease you know going into the fall i think collectively that you know things can change and you know we have the flu season coming and and things get worse typically in the winter so it's a very good question i do think you know we don't wanna be love about the optimism because you know it's it's a long road here and um you know maybe the toughest time ahead of us the good news is i think is i think bethany pointed out and i pointed out and we've all seen there's just been a lot of improvement on true and how to deal with this and so i think we all feared obviously in the front end that hospitals would just be totally overwhelmed and obviously that was tested in a couple of places including new york and and i think the good news is we came out on the better end of what we all feared and so you know you're seeing it as you said in hotspots you know houston went through it and you're seeing different places um and and the good news is they they seem to be handling it and it's not creating these long lengthy shutdowns you know you did see in texas the governor trying to push you know some some again you know policies there but it really actually was a bit of a carve out for ascs you know in some of the outpatient surgeries it was more about protecting that inpatient capacity so i do think you're gonna see a little bit of that we do have to brace for that um in terms of hotspots i don't think it's you know nationwide shut it all down the way it was early on it's gonna be much more targeted and you know i'm no expert anymore than anybody on the phone but as we watch this move around the country you know it's kind out of it's the hot spot it's these you know fires that kind of come up and then burn out and i hope that continues to you know you know be loud you know and contained but um i i think it's very encouraging what we're seeing and even though we might you know experience some some issues i think we're encouraged i mean the public companies that report their surgery numbers have been really incredible um so i don't think there's a big hesitation to come back and do it it'll just be a matter of you know the public health officials continue to sort of treat this in a target way rather than a blanket way and and we think that will be the case okay um my second question uh and last question is what what is your perspective of how the hospital industry um looks like after this is all done i mean would you say the hospital in business not the medical office business per se but the hospital business is weakened by all this um in the sense that you know we kind of went in over hospital to begin with and and maybe this fast tracks some consolidation or closings that probably or maybe would've done happened eventually uh i'm just wondering if if you think sort of picking your your your um your relationships become even more important in the aftermath because hospital the hospital industry overall is is probably a notch weaker be as of everything that happened yeah i think it's a fair fair assessment and good commentary we were having a discussion with our board earlier this week about that with several health system leaders there on our board and and and i think it's what you said you're gonna it's it's the classic you know problem that these crises just like the financial crisis caused the strong are gonna get stronger the weaker gonna get weaker and there's different dynamics to that but in the hospital world that's very true and and you know you're seeing an hca do extremely well you know coming through this and i think they they do a good job of figuring it out and and there's a lot of not for profit systems that are leaders in their markets i do think the strength and scale matters um larger systems versus small independent system obviously you know more more urban uh versus in suburban versus rural is gonna be a huge trend i know the trend of moving into the cities everybody's questioning a little bit but i still think those strong um you know population growth centers are gonna be where you're gonna see the success and so i do think you are correct that picking the right partners will matter more being a sharp shooter will will continue to be critical for success and i think that's something we've been ever since we sort of found that trend to be true from the financial crisis even before so it it's true i i do think you're right hospitals probably taken you know certainly they've clearly taken a hit and were helped a lot by the cares act um and cms in general but i do think we are encouraged that the strong ones i mean this is a demand need-based business you know this isn't just uh you know selling uh luxury items it's very much need-based and so there's a huge need for it in pa as i made my comments a remark it i mean hospitals are proving that they're so critical and i think the acuity level of hospitals is only gonna continue to climb and you're gonna see acuity level of outpatient climb both on and off campus it's a continuum and i think um you know all those innovations will con in you and uh it will be a little bit more of a winter versus loser at game and and i think we're we're pretty well positioned to follow that trend and as related to that response thanks tod that was great um do you think the long way monetization of hospital and medical office will will be you know more of a realistic outcome of this even for stronger hospitals that maybe are now taking on you know more market share need more technological advanced and so on is is that something that we can finally say well it's not not to get religious but it's like testing our faith right in this theory and it's just we gotta keep the whole live right um we just haven't seen it is the real answer um it has all the makings to suggest that would be possibly true um we have a very contradicting data point here with the mercy transaction that we just did a little bit of a specific situation where they had a propensity you know to to wanna own their assets uh so a little different but we've heard of a few other anecdotes just recently of some other hospitals doing similar things so uh you know hospital systems think strategically very differently they don't focus i mean as they should they focus on providing care and all the things they need to do to expand their business and succeed they're not sitting around thinking about cap rates for mobs but i say there's gonna be there are gonna be some more of those it may be a little bit more from your stress systems and so then weeding through that back to your earlier question figuring out is it worth it is it the right systems to be with is the question for that great great thanks for much thanks thanks rich the next question will come from john ten with bmo capital please go ahead thanks good morning um todd in your opening remarks um and you know you mentioned same joint ai training back at three percent which is certainly against recent trends of not only hr but other mlb leads and just wondering if you could just discuss your confidence levels and that's and if that's being driven by oxford you picking up or leasing spreads on on leases that you're negotiating now i think the simple answer is and chris always hits this it's that our average contractual rent bump across you know multi tenant and single tenant is two point eight three percent it's two point eight nine for the multi tenant so that's that's the driver of of our same store growth and and what chris always walks through is okay we we grew the revenue at that level and then you're right you you advance that ball a little bit with cash leasing spreads but that's a pretty small piece of the pie each you know quarter or a year um so you you do help that you do have a little bit of you know turnover as well that kind of hurts that but the revenue model is more of a you know high twos kind of number and then really it becomes you know what are your expenses doing and how much operating leverage do you have your margin and so that's the algorithm we see it gets us there pretty conservatively with but it's really the big driver is is our revenue model of our escalators and and we continue to feel good about that the cash leasing spreads help at the margin absolutely and and as chris talked you know we're looking to try to drive up to as we go into twenty one and that will help also but even without a lot of uh of increased absorption you can see same store uh in oi growth running you know around three and how does three runs uh into this number cause i imagine you're offering more free rent or you have more recently chris do you wanna touch on that yeah i mean obviously free rent will go into it if if if you have a larger percent uh percentage of it versus what you have before but i'll say generally no we're not adding a lot of free rent um you know we really don't have much of any inside of our renewals if we're if we're doing it at all it typically is inside of new leasing um and so when you have that uh with the new leasing it just kind of creates a little bit of delay before you see the the revenue impact from that absorption um but uh but overall no we've we've not seen um a marked expansion of of free rent okay and then uh maybe i'll ask nick joseph's question a little bit differently um i think that you mentioned a hundred fifty million dollars of acquisitions you had under contracts and now you've closed eighty two million dollars post quarter are you still on track to close that remaining seventy million or so or have any of those deals fall apart uh yes we're still on track to close those um i think we've got um i think i mentioned we have a hundred sixty three million um that's either under contract or or loi so we've we've actually increased that uh under contract amounts this the last time and and i think rob too you said and we we expect that we will close those to categories under contract and a lot by your end which is what will help us get those mercy proceeds reinvested by your end right and before at jason's uh acquisitions uh you you mentioned that health systems are those health systems that all tenants in the building required um they have i would say that there are have certainly have physicians that are utilizing the hospital um next door um i think there's one where the hospital um is not a tenant but but all the others are are tenant by the hospital great thank you thanks john our next question will come from todd stander with wells fargo please go ahead thanks probably in order just to stick with that last theme about the assets under contract and maybe this is for um can you speak to the condition of those buildings i know historically you guys are compared to put some redevelopment dollars into them um but in the context of maybe todd what you were speaking to maybe tis come down maybe just getting some broader thoughts about how you guys are allocating capital thanks yeah i would say that um the assets that we're in a contract to to purchase early i mean they're all in good condition i mean we're not planning to invest us a significant amount of capital um into any of them as a as a re-development play if that's if that's answering your question it is thank you and then maybe for god um did i hear that right maybe expectation of lower tis coming down the road i think that's a twenty twenty phenomenon we're not necessarily suggesting that um looking into twenty one we actually think it should rebound to sort of historical levels in relationship ups um and and all that is is is what we've heard some others say too we had slower tours and and new leasing activity with new perspective net new tenants that create absorption which is where you have higher t i spend uh in in the second quarter you know especially april and even a little in may and therefore you get this flag effect of when those tenants would normally take occupancy and that's probably a third and fourth quarter phenomenon so it's really a back half issue and even a little bit you saw it in the second quarter so so um you know that's all we're saying and then back to sort of normalized levels in twenty one okay i would clarify that too of you know that that's a little bit on the perspective leasing front what ties talking about of of and we don't know for sure we're kind of running different scenarios so we're looking at one scenario that yes we could see a little bit less absorption here in the next couple of quarters and then rebounding um which could have an impact but then also as you look at it in terms of total spin and you start looking at fad right now we are running uh at the low end and frankly a little below the low end of our guidance range uh is it relates to second gen ta um and so there's just timing that is always related to that uh so that may you know pick up certainly we think will in the range back to you know potentially near the midpoint of the range um and so that's part of what what is playing into the guidance as it relates to uh to fad in my prepared remarks i talked about you know right now we are running significantly below um where we are on a on a trailing twelve month basis but um you know we do think that that that can pick up in the later half of the year and and what drives our our view that uh our fad payout ratio we'll we'll probably end up the year down in the in the low ninety uh not in the the low eighties that you saw this quarter so i just wanted to to clarify that point that's helpful cause that's where i was going ultimately with this is seeing that fed pay out ratio decline and and in the in the spirit of seeing maybe some dividend out at some point um but maybe it doesn't shake out that low okay that's helpful all right that's it for me thank you next time the next question will come from tao okay <unk> please go ahead yes good morning everyone congrats on the transactions that makes perfect sense to me uh my focus is really on the outlook for the mobs i i think you mentioned your comments earlier on that the you know hospitals in general and associated will be seemed to be doing well when we kind of you know think about hca results and some of the other hospital operators but a lot of that is also kind of due to the math of the lot of grants they've kind of received over this period as well um could you just kind of talk about how you're thinking about kind of in the world where they're new grants or in a world where you know where that source of government funding is decreased maybe in the next you know act that's that congress and that you know what do you kind of see happens in that world i mean specifically could we start to say deferrals going up again or or you know would know for you guys to just kind of expand on that well it's you know it's it's all speculation obviously tao but it's it's interesting um you know i think we saw the most extreme thing hopefully that we'll ever see uh in our lifetimes right but maybe not a much of that right right so you know april was just absolutely extreme and and clearly the government steps in and we just hope you know we don't see that again but i think we've as i mentioned we've learned a lot and i think we learned that hospitals uh you know good or bad you know hospitals and positions they really make a lot of money on the elective uh procedure side and surgeries and when that was shut down i mean you're cutting off the most profitable segment of the business and you know healthcare it's it's a little cold to say that because obviously they're only doing they're only supposed to be doing what's necessary but it is necessary there's a ton of that need and so when you cut off that lifeblood if you will uh it really hurts those systems so i think now if you go back to the discussions earlier where it's more of a targeted approach and maybe you know for a short period in houston they they ask you know for some elective procedures to be to be you know reduced and not even in all ascs but in hospitals so i think you're gonna see a more targeted approach um rather than the sort of absolute you know month long or more shut down so it should therefore it shouldn't be quite as financial difficult um you know is it gonna be tough yeah just like schools schools for a lot of us you know with kids and it's gonna be tough you know as soon as they shut down the school for a week or two or something or or even if you're lucky if they're open so there's gonna be ebbs and flows as i mentioned i remarks but i think we're much better shape today than we were when we knew very little in march so i don't think it's as dire as you know we could all fear but you know it's never david ever used to always say it's never as good or as bad as it may seem and that's probably area appropriate here it it it will be not easy but it i don't think it's gonna be as bad as it was and and i it's not changing our outlook about hospitals and on campus mobs um we'll watch that just like everybody but i think in my own experience you know personally if you've ever dealt with a family member or a friend or loved one whatever it might be who's had a serious illness you don't think twice about going to the hospital or going to that you know high acuity specialist that might be near the hospital when it gets real this that's what this is about you know the light touch stuff and it's really cool that there's innovations that can do things you know in lower costs you know off campus settings and that's fine that's a very real thing and and not to say that trends not real but you know we we think the dynamics of real estate and demand supply and demand are best where it's that high acuity sort of of nucleus if you will around the hospital and and as rich as you know we gotta watch that nucleus make sure it's healthy the hospitals that we're working with so that that's our focus gotcha good that's helpful thank you
