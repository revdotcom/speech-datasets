assistance please press star and zero the conference must not be recorded for publication or broadcast at this time it's my pleasure to hand over to dr <unk> <unk> please go ahead sir thank you <unk> good morning good day good afternoon and good evening to all of you and welcome to the analyst conference on this annual half year twenty twenty results of <unk> international age our cfo marcus blanca and i welcome you from sunny switzerland we published our half year results and there is perspective slide tech earlier today and as always let's get started on slide three over the first year over the first half of the year the <unk> group successfully managed to deliver excellence service for customers in the face of an unprecedented challenges post by the covid nineteen pandemic this started was the very abrupt hold to chinese export in february followed by lockdowns in march and and a deliberate pace of day-to-day recovery thanks to our dedicated colleague and a seamless transition of approximately forty five thousand staff to home office in a matter of days our customers faced no deep radiation of service quality despite extraordinary volatility and demand for essential goods this community in substantial market share gains across all transactional business units from the five and perspective the groups performance in quarter two is a testament to our flexible asset light business model and our efforts to optimally variabilize a meaningful portion of our short term fixed cost and looking at those four key figures that are in front of you you will see that the net turn over decreased by seven point five percent heavily impacted by an ethics effect of five point nine percent versus previous year gross profit went down by nine point one percent and the ebit by eighteen percent down to four hundred nineteen millions with frank in the first half of twenty twenty earnings per share landed at point five eight with frank's per share please follow me on the next slide slide four with a couple of details on the group and the business units group earnings for the period of the first six months we're at three hundred nine million swiss friends and we generated a strong free cash flow of three hundred eighty three million swiss friends looking at the four business units let's start with sea logistics we have sea an ebit of one hundred sixty seven million for strengths which were twenty eight percent below previous year as a result of a shift in cargo mix less sm e volumes and a positive refer and pharma development also the demand for rail solution especially at china started to uh pick up strongly as of june last quarter al logistics and ebit of one hundred eighty one million swiss strengths has been the chief which is four percent higher than previous year based on a high demand for crisis codes but also a demand for special solutions such as c and air volumes which more than triggers in quarter two twenty twenty road logistics ended the first semester was an ebit of twenty six millions with strengths all networks were maintained and europe now is slowly recovering why the americas are still suffering from the effects of the pandemic and contract logistics and uh the first semester was an ebit of forty five million west ranks twenty one percent below previous year um seeing a high demand of essential goats and uh answering the gross profit decline with strict cost management almost matching the gross profit development on slide six we will discuss briefly the volume development in sea logistics and the logistics please let me start with sea logistics first we have a pronounced effort uh in sea logistics especially on the in our own networks uh in sea logistics especially on maintaining our own network capacity which used it in significant market share gains across all segments but especially in pharma and refer and the e commerce segment the cargo makes i mentioned that before showed a significantly lower sme volume and this is higher yielding as we have mentioned in some of our previous calls the market demand is continuously recovering over the course of quarter two but it's still below previous year let me give you some uh hints on how market uh how sorry how how our volume develop um months by months in quarter two we so april was a fifteen percent one five percent volume decrease but gaining market share ended our volumes in may by only minus twelve percent and the june volumes already showed a minus eight percent and volume decrease so gradually we see volumes picking up again but still lower than previous year in total we ship two hundred seventeen thousand t u s in our networks uh which resulted into um eleven point seven percent reduction in quarter two and a nine point one percent reduction in volumes for the first semester twenty twenty foresee logistics air logistics are a significant the lower demand for dry cargo and perishables and both are lower yielding as you know a strong demand for century goods which were higher yielding and mainly produced or operated in a charter uh via charter business uh because the recovery uh of belly is not expected to see or show significant effects before quarter for this year the sawing demand for seeing air solutions and also a monthly development that was rather stable by minus twenty three to minus twenty percent april to june in total the first semester a reduction in volume of minus fifteen point five percent how does this translate now into the unit performance of the business units and please for on me on slide seven first see logistics mentioned this already two times now for the third time carbon mixes lower sme volumes volume gains and pharma e-commerce and river and a stable margin development per unit and constant current see on the next slide slide eight you see the details of the development the gross profit makes us the driver of the unit profitability and uh with an x effect of a currency effect to six percent five to six percent uh on the unit basis uh you have or you see a constant development or constant margin <unk> uh in quarter two this year all cost measures uh were in tech and uh including the table from fx or from currency we saw a reduction in the cost level per unit uh as well um the uh ebits for tou is well below our normal ebit but this includes also headwind from currency of six percent uh so in totally at the lower end of the range that we usually pursue uh eighty to a hundred uh um switch banks t u ebit per t u but it's recovering and uh we also see some seasonal effects kicking in um we are full cool seeing especially in seal logistics on excellent customer service and we have one significant business which already related or resulted in less volume reductions than one might have expected from the market here movement uh and quarter two has been stronger and improving months by months uh with regards to both volume margin and profitable unit profitability like my and logistics the general chicago volume declined significantly i will comment on this on the next slide and the demand for higher yielding crisis codes has sort um the market demand has been much weaker and quarter to as anticipated we have to say um the regular dry cargos or the general cargo the normal cargo that we transport especially in the belly capacity has been down by minus forty to minus fifty percent and this has been offset by crisis volumes um essential goods uh but not only crisis volumes um essential goods uh but not only p p e uh but also uh package foods uh package food as well as e-commerce volumes um went into into that um segment power sugars were down in april and may but the recovery started already in june and we also see hard cut or general cargo coming back step by step as of june this year um we had a spike in charter business uh while belly was not existing which led to unit figures that are skewed uh by a different way of producing air logistics and um our unit years as you can see is clearly above our normal range of seventy to eighty five swiss frank per a hundred keto uh that i'm sorry no <unk> uh uh for for the normal uh volumes transported in the unit ebit is also above uh normal despite higher uh currency wins um and this marks a fifty percent increase in quarter two uh versus previous quarter due to the beneficial volume mix uh the cost consciousness also in this business unit as well as the first uh air lock efficiencies that we have seen kicking in into that segment slide eleven a short overview on road logistics europe is slowly recovering by the water in america stay at a low and very low level at the moment this is true for balls into model as well as truck brokerage we have seen slide twelve now we have seen a faster massive material of volumes in europe at the start of quarter two and i think we mentioned that when we when we had our quarter one analyst call with you uh and the order of the the order of magnitude has been higher than fifty percent volume reductions but that was true for two three weeks only and we see a steady volume recovery step by step especially in domestic transports in europe at the moment us followed uh with a sharp volume decline end of april uh and especially intermodated more or less collapsed and um we see a steady recovery uh in june uh since june in europe and a stabilizer several on a low level in the us at the moment um international and cross border which is a higher yielding business those transports are still lagging but also here we see volumes coming back in um all our networks have been maintained and we are ready to deal with uh cargo kicking in and in some markets i will not say the geography um we have even had to reject certain while you because our networks were finished again in june that's true for domestic transports um we saw a very strong growth in bookings uh on our digital road plan form called <unk> and uh we have uh been able to roll this out um even uh in a in a virtual environment over the last couple of months in many asian countries and we see the wall i'm sorry on that platform at the moment while ebit uh was uh forty two percent below previous year we generated a positive ebit of twenty six millions with springs and in all of the case scenario uh we would not have um expected a uh a positive quarter two in road logistics given the character of our networks so we are very proud of what has been achieved here uh countering um uh volume reductions with cost measures like thirteen contract logistics and i have to say contract logistics short high resilience and it short to face is the ugly phase if i may say so uh was industries that clearly were down trading automotive and industrial to name two and uh we had complete shutdowns uh by customers and sometimes by governments in those industries for two three four six up to eight weeks uh and uh some of the volumes have not recovered even to a sizeable um uh level again then prior to the crisis and there was a couple of nice faces that we saw were up trading industries the pharma and head scan industry up trading industries the pharma and head scan industry the the industry for essential goods which is packaged food and food and consumers and also e-commerce and here the volumes were well above seasonal peaks and we had ex-car shifts that we had to introduce the especially on the weekends to cope with the sore and spike in demand ninety percent were up to eighty five to ninety percent of our sites remained open throughout the whole crisis and currently we only have twelve sites that are still closed out of more than six hundred sites globally so we see a clear confirmation that fifty percent of our solution portfolio is related to a essential goods and this demand has never stopped or has never been reduced some details on the contract logistics business unit on slide fourteen um the implementation of the covid nineteen sops or operating procedures across all operations were introduced but they also added a lot of cost and the loss of efficiencies while we were doing everything to protect our staff uh we lost clearly efficiencies cleaning disinfection between shifts no overlap of shifts any more segregation of workflow between shifts led to a lower productivity and higher costs obviously but the excellence uh the excellent cost management um that uh contract logistics introduced immediately was the crisis becoming one uh so as of february um clearly short progress and we were excluding the pressure from um the uh exchange rate uh we were able to uh counter the top line revenue pressure uh with cost measures almost entirely and and uh that is a for such a huge business unit employing so many people that's a huge effort and a great result um so the high portion in our solution portfolio of uh essential goods so at high resilience and uh believes that largely backed by contracts with customers back to back so we have more than fifty percent of our sites are so called dedicated sites so we were not exposed to an over course the lease uh without any activity in too many sites nevertheless um uh we we saw a development end of quarter one and early quarter two but if you look into the figures um the uh old our performance uh including the fx effects uh is uh only eleven point three percent uh lower net turnover and in ebit um almost on the level of previous year what to and uh having said so i i'm happy to hand over to my colleague marcus uh to lead you to the key financial figures thank you very much that just welcome to all participants also from my side a very special second quarter indeed uh time it was characterized by unusual business pattern i think uh we had quite some opposite focus uh on business management focus on uh in the business units air freight can be uh uh can be described by just make it happen uh uh times where customers as much as on the carrier side i think a lot of creativity was being required to make things happen on the other side as that we've mentioned in contract logistics clear focus on uh on cost containment and cost management so a lot of time we have been confronted with the fact that traditional kpis key performance indicators had been not extremely helpful we needed to look differently at the business because it was a very special situation but and uh i want to lead you on the patient number sixteen i think the result ultimately was a quite good one and uh when you look at the magnitude of impact what uh such a unusual business can happen is uh when you look at the gross profit development from the se from the first and the second quarter to compared to last year we have actually lost in the second quarter two hundred sixty five million gross profit compared to last year that is two and a half time more than in the first quarter however on an ebitda level we actually have been at the same even better level than compared to uh to the first quarter so we only if you like still a big number but it's quarter so we only if you like still a big number but only had a reduction in w d a of thirty million out of a cross profit reduction of two hundred sixty five so there's quite a lot of uh the call contain and the cost management in between that i think uh uh you can you can appreciate was uh was quite a piece of hard work to uh to get that done um going further down in the pnl of course on an e b t level yes we are around eighteen percent behind last year on a half year basis so nineteen million ninety um of which and that's not an excuse just the fact of around twenty mill are coming out of uh out of foreign currency exchange so seventy million from an operational perspective uh reduced reduction versus last year so in relative terms i believe the second quarter and that's also very apparent was even better than the first quarter um patient number seventeen let's talk about er and c freight in that context the e-touch uh project and the automation initiatives behind that we have presented the potential of the initiatives in commercial terms and our full year two thousand and nineteen presentation so what do you see here is may really an update where we stand uh it's not a new assessment of uh values it's just uh an update on progress and i think uh you can appreciate we have uh sets the baseline in many uh areas in air freight um our operating system airlock is uh is uh fully rolled out in two thousand nineteen which is uh prerequisite for many of the touch uh initiatives not all of them but many of those and you can see despite the fact that q2 has been a challenging environment to put through uh uh projects but we have continued to drive uh er initiatives and we made pretty good progress at least in one thirty five core uh areas the one that is custom of booking and order entry um i think the message here is yes we do not expect expect any miracles right now in a current situation with uh still over good three months people working partially from home uh partially just what i said trying to keep up service in an in an accident manner but some of these projects have a slide delay the message that i want to give you here is e touch is on track patient number eighteen balance sheet um i'm only gonna talk about uh uh three four components of course some of them housekeeping first one trade receiver was biggest uh uh item uh on the balance sheets three points uh two three point three billion uh by the end of june uh twenty twenty compared to three point six billion uh not surprisingly again uh uh here we see a position where a business volume uh has reduced like and you know it's a function basically of rates and and volume and of course a currency impact also on that uh on that position that is reducing the overall a hand secondly and um arguably more important cash and cash equivalent um i think our balance sheet is draw with a with a gross cash position here of nearly one point two billion uh translated into that cash off around seven hundred sixty million uh which compares to roughly nine hundred million respectively four hundred eighty million by the end of the first quarter twenty twenty so um simple to a very good uh development in uh cash generation um in light i think of the decision and you have read it in the uh in the news today in light of the decision to propose the distribution of a dividend to the shareholders of four screen string uh we have calculated a performance cash position at that point in time and that would still be positive with two hundred eighteen million um just as a housekeeping topic here uh you are aware that uh we have have a revolving credit facility available to us which is entirely undrawn so nothing has been used so far in the extent or at the frame of seven hundred fifty million um coming back to the next item on the balance sheet asset health for sale also here information purposes this is the value that we have or that is the scope of the business that we have signed a contract of the rest then with xpo you can see a very transparent asset health for sale you can see a very transparent asset health for sale four hundred million liabilities associated with these asset health for sale three hundred so the next asset value of that business to be carved out is around a hundred million equity ratio i'm sure you have already calculated that yourself from december twenty three point six percent an increase to twenty five point nine percent so i think the solidity of the balance sheet is also in these rough times and unusual times a benefit uh nevertheless balance sheet is one thing cash is cash is king uh so main topic cash uh going uh swiftly to page number nineteen um operational cash flow you can see that here in the first half twenty twenty around eight hundred and four million similar level then last year uh with around eight hundred eight hundred seventy two million um however when we go down a little bit and look at the total cash and cash equivalent situation we have an increase on the cash balance of around six hundred sixty six million be reminded at that point in time um that included last year dividend payments to the amount of seven hundred twenty million so comparably at similar level free cash flow generation really what we are looking at very resilient free cash flow generation also in the second quarter so i'm talking second quarter not half year in the second quarter of two hundred twenty seven million which compares to two hundred twenty three million so uh let's talk about crisis or non crisis free cash flow generation has been uh at the very same level as as uh as last year um excluding some of the dispar and this gives you a bit of an idea on how much extraordinary uh components are in there excluding the disposals the underlying free cash flow for the second quarter was still two hundred twenty one so the the the the swing that we talk to you to uh uh disposals is um uh a very neglectable i think six million out of the free cashflow um for everybody who runs some of the models i think you can see here from the investing activities um the cross capex the run rates of the capex that we spend into the business is currently aiming at around two hundred million on an annual basis which is which is significantly low were then we had seen over the last couple of years um some of the some of the drivers of course is uh the content logistics disposal of the of the of part of the uk business at the same time we also very diligently working on the usage of uh long-term leases according drive for sixteen rather than uh uh i'll try to purchase um looking at the pattern in time so the the trajectory of the free cash i think when you look at the curve on the page nineteen on the right side uh there is no reason to believe that uh should look differently at least in the in the third quarter than it was last year again be reminded in the fourth quarter we had an extraordinary impact in two thousand nineteen so we should expect a more uh uh even uh development into the fort order also for twenty twenty going to patient number twenty and i only touched uh the accounts receivable quickly on the balance sheet um when i when i talked about the balance sheet here you see trade receivables uh have decreased uh over a year over year by around four hundred million the reasons that i mentioned already uh trade payables around two hundred sixty million so our networking capital is down around one hundred forty six million um what's more important our kpis and dsos and ds we were able to keep especially on the ds all sides data sales outstanding uh a number around fifty four fifty five so we have a deviation of zero point four days uh many questions coming along our way obviously is there pressure from customers on extended payment terms yes there is very clear yes there is but uh i think um uh we will see more pressure coming in the third and fourth quarter uh we are we are holding up uh quite well i think uh services one of the one of the important arguments to uh to maintain uh uh the dsls at the same time i think uh our focus moves towards the risk profile behind the counter parties uh i do expect i do expect going forward for the next two to three quarters uh an increase in the risk two to three quarters uh an increase in the risk profile on counter party risks um so nothing bad happened so far i wanna underline that it's uh it's uh uh uh no uh no big um uh defaults or anything like that but i would expect that the pressure is also here uh getting higher uh until the end of the year and maybe into the first half year twenty twenty one um return on capital employed uh page number twenty one okay so much twenty one um you see that little inflection point that we had here uh uh from sixty percent up to sixty six sixty seven and i think that was a that was a good sign so now we see a little bit of the the covid nineteen fact uh uh that it that uh pushed it down to sixty two percent again uh very clear and i just wrote it for for uh for clarity just decided uh uh the sudden decrease of uh the profitability that we have seen <unk> on a very similar asset uh is uh obviously mathematically leading to a bit of a uh a bit of a uh compression on this one however from a target perspective we maintain our financial our financial uh targets uh with around seventy percent return captain employee that should be possible um the good news and at the same time i think they expected also from some of you news uh is on the next page patient number twenty two um uh dividend proposal just to put also some clarity around conversations we had over the last years uh you know that we never had a formal rich and dividend policy uh uh as it is uh uh all decision making power remains uh with the board of directors and the general assembly um that having said the actual payout ratio in the recent years was always consent stent with uh also our verbal communication to a distribution uh of around seventy five percent of the uh net profit after tax um uh clearly uh now the buildings uh proposal is based on uh on uh uh the assessment of the market conditions and also the uh groups uh performance and likely ongoing performance and as you can see here uh that proposal to the annual or the extra ordinary uh general meeting uh on september second will be to pay out the dividend of uh force fish frame financial targets and uh last slide from uh from uh my present patient uh i think uh uh you'll see on the life side uh the group financial target conversion rate eleven to sixteen percent i think everybody's clear one of the main drivers e touch uh return on capital employed i just uh spoke about it i think when we come back to uh regular profitability based on our asset based seventy percent is uh is in reach working capital intensity i want to talk about that first working capital intensity uh currently three point nine percent and uh you might have noticed i have uh intentionally uh widened a little bit the corridor from uh top end four and a half percent to five percent uh uh for a simple reason because i believe that is anticipating a reflection of pressure on counter party risk and potential dsos for the next four quarters um tax rate uh tax rate i think uh very important to look at this one is a housekeeping topic um for you also to uh update on your models uh we expect a group uh uh effective tax rate of around twenty four to twenty six percent up from around twenty four to twenty five as per our latest communication this is just reflecting the current shift in the business and geographic mix so just that you're not surprised on your models um right sides the four business units you see the first line our our actual performance in volumes but underneath the the part of everybody was really waiting for that is the update on the market expectations for twenty twenty and the outlook and uh as you can imagine i think we're in line with many of our peers uh we are not giving any um you know i think the performance that the group has shown so far gives us a certain confidence in our ability also to manage through what we believe is gonna still be volatile and highly uncertainly is gonna still be volatile and highly uncertain market also for the rest of the year and as the market outlook remains extremely uncertain to us as well we offer again no placed financial guidance for the group no volume guidance until the end of the year very sorry for that but at the current stage you will have to or we will all have to live with guest working and a bit of fact color of what we said on our past performance uh with that little lack of outlook uh i will hand over to uh dentist and uh thank you marcus and the lack of outlook maybe marks the whole year because in the pandemic we have to fly on site that is the saying we have as far as we can look ahead we uh initiate measures and activities and uh the rest is agility and activity to a situation that you can't really predict on slide twenty four i wanna make a couple of remarks logistics is and we'll stay people's business even in a more one more digital environment and we have embarked on this road our roadmap twenty twenty two which started in two thousand eighteen and we are in the middle of that roadmap roadmap deployment lens customer technology and people and we believe that the covid nineteen pandemic and the last six months have clearly shown that we have embarked on the right strategy we stayed fully operational throughout the crisis and continue serving our customers with our high a quality services throughout the world and i would highly like to thank our colleagues for their commitment and passion and to our customers for their trust and loyalty thank you without you the first semester would've looked differently and that's the energy and passion of the best logistics team in our industry and having said so i would like to hand over back to sandra to open q and a we will now begin the question and answer session anyone who wishes to ask a question may press star and one on the touch on telephone you will hear a tone to confirm that you have entered the queue if you wish to remove yourself from the question queue you may press and two participants are requested to use only hands as well asking a question anyone with a question may press star and one at this time the first question comes from daniel <unk> from <unk> please go ahead thanks good afternoon thanks for taking the questions three of that many um could you elaborate what is enabling the market share gain especially during your crisis like this one in your view and kind of who's losing it um and then how much of that market share gain will you be able to retain kind of as things move more back to normal um you also talked a little bit about your cost reduction efforts and in today's report you showed about eighty seven thousand employees down from about ninety eight um ask you at the same point now how much does that decrease kind of let's call it a rough ten thousand employees is driven by the timber every furlough programs and how much due to actual sustainable reductions that then will benefit you kind of as you ramp back up and um tying this also to e touch um back at the financial your results you talked about twenty million annualized savings so far um any indication on how this has progressed in the past six months and um you know do you expect that the automation will enable you to keep staff members lower as volumes go back up or how are you thinking about kind of really driving e-touch through the business thanks thanks daniel let me answer those questions let me start with the letter one because we have alluded to that a couple of times it's not about staff reduction you touch is enabling us to do more business and to drive business segments or grows in business segments with a traditionally lower margin but with the high conversion rate still very attractive club that is in touch um market share gains uh we have mentioned that uh we were able to gain market share because we changed the the whole organization into addressing actively customers um after easter so we were engaged with all existing customers and um potential customers target customers as we call them and we had in action virtually was all of them a couple of times for all the week and months and we won business we won business without having met the customer physically and uh we were winning business because we were operational and many of our mid-sized and smaller competitors were not operating of our mid-sized and smaller competitors were not operational they struggled to create operations up and running so that also would to answering your question who lost the lower part of the pyramid is the one that is under highest pressure technology connectivity uh and also uh perhaps an ability of operating systems is a big challenge many of them and especially in a unprecedented situation that we all went through worldwide over the last three four or five months um that proved to be a big risk and a big problem because you couldn't overcome any of those to efficiencies by just calling someone or going somewhere you have to prove your systems and technology are working um how much can we retain i would say we we we convince our customers by quality we don't convince by price we your quality surprise supplier and the customers that have made the experience over the last six months or in the past in general they stay with us we have a lot of customers that we retain because of our high quality service and that's part of our roadmap twenty twenty two strategy customer excellence is at the center of all the topics we do we don't wanna win transactional business just for the sake of winning it for and operating it for one two or three months we want customers to stay with us and see how much of our solution portfolio can generate benefits for them cost reduction efforts um i think um we have made a lot of efforts uh with all the programs that are in place but not only uh we have optimized uh our workforce uh we have uh reduced capacity very quiet but we shifted capacity to those operations sometimes in this same city or even the same wells where demands spiked so there is no rule we have only a few temporary labor i think it's two thousand a bit more than two thousand ten labor less than we had a year ago uh and this is uh driven by the effect that we see much higher demand still in some of the essential goods uh segments especially uh pharma healthcare and ecommerce and this from our point of view sustainable board this would stay so in a in different words daniel i would say we made a organic growth experience compressed in five months maybe or four months that we usually would have gone through our customers in the period of eighteen months and i would say that is to a large extent sticky and stays and will not be reversed right thanks the next question comes from <unk> from city group please go ahead uh yeah thank you good afternoon <unk> thanks for taking my questions i have three questions uh firstly could you please elaborate on what you trends through the quarter from smes which markets are actually seeing weakness versus the relative strength secondly in twenty nineteen on your sdna expense was around four forty five million okay so could you please update on the current con rate on s d n a finally what has been your workforce return rate from remote working across the markets can you re people last question please i i didn't know uh in terms of uh in terms of work who's uh returning back to office uh what has been your written rate so for across key markets okay so what young trends um which market so as you know the whole pandemic started mid of january already in in asia and usually this is not an sme market or we are we we have a much higher portion of uh of blue chip cut but in europe uh it's mainly the sme customers that dropped out of business very fast uh and the recovery is starting when i started now in june i would say so the first sign of a recovery of sme customers uh has been seen in june in europe and partly in in other markets but mainly in europe and um this this will take time it will not come overnight um at the moment of pandemic uh it is here the americas and uh we see that uh we have still volumes that are down and not recovering but here uh i would say it has bottomed out so we are more positive uh today than we were three months ago when we discussed the quarter one results um i would say um despite regional and local setbacks um despite regional and local setbacks um the pandemic is not over by we have all managed and understood how to handle it and governments have initiated uh enough protective uh health measures uh in order to secure the people and make them continue on assuming um the sge run rate uh has a lot of components um and uh it starts with trevor for example i do not expect trevor to come back this year to say this clearly intercontent that you enter travel i would not expect to see any of the flights intercontinental versus green and stuff on it uh before september if at all and and then we have made such a positive experience on winning new customers uh and and and uh such a positive experience with willing customers and so on uh online and virtual only that uh you could say every second trip can be spired in general moving forward and then we have a currency effect as well there's a a currency effect in sge um because we translate everything into into the heart currency swiss rank and that hasn't effected itself as well i hope that answers your questions the next question comes from david <unk> and jeffrey please go ahead thank you good afternoon uh gentleman uh questions please from my side first on uh on sea logistics it turns out that the uh volume development uh is uh is better than expected as the quarter progressed and i was wondering did you see a not noticeable impact from a shift from from <unk> due to the lack of capacity in in air freight then secondly in in logistics you you benefited from i think in constant currency uh thirty four percent uh higher yield and now with the air freight markets starting to know again would you expect that that average yield also normalizes back to the range that you indicated in your presentation of seventy to eighty five switch banks per performance kilogram or do you expect to be able to continue to to do better than that range and in five only on on road logistics i think the organic revenue was down twenty percent in the second quarter but that's a mix of of europe and north america okay provides some color on how weak north america really was and with decrease of twenty percent does it still imply that you gained market share in the second quarter because i think some of your peers refer to the market down only fifteen percent in the second quarter thanks very much sure david so let me answer your questions um see logistics um yes we had a better volume development than expected uh but uh any shift from air to see is insignificant for c sorry for saying so yeah one frater has one hundred has one hundred kilos and uh one hundred tons and uh we are talking about i don't know uh six eight containers uh though it's a different business model you can't compare it but what we saw is and that is a good combination i mentioned that is the arc combination yeah so yeah you go into dubai viac and then you go into final distribution even to south america via air and this combination uh this solution um is in light of the lacking uh supply side of freighter capacity especially in china um got a lot of uh tailwind and uh i mentioned that uh our volumes here spiked uh more than three times the normal volume that we see so this combination showed a certain progress logistics um i think i mentioned that during the presentation we expect especially in the second semester that the higher years was a very special or was was a result of a very special supply and demand situation in quarter two and that the normalized years of seventeen to eighty five swiss springs per a hundred kilo uh will come in or will kick in uh again gradually not overnight and not on a fingertips but uh gradually um road logistics um i think uh our comms are we have so many different figures in the market and not being able to predict even what has happened or describe really what has happened is um i think what we have to all of us have to be very careful is uh let me describe a situation that we experience in europe and then i come to the us um europe we have volume reductions of fifty sixty percent and within weeks this happened in the first one two three weeks in april but then this spot mode and the recovery gradually started already uh as of may so the figure you see is in every fifty uh as of may so the figure you see is an ever figure of a volume development that had a lot of slumps and spikes and a lot of shifts over the last weeks at the moment i or we all believed that the volumes are gradually kind back and they stay it's not a one time short and in the us i think we are still on a very low level but as i mentioned it has gotten out so long story short it was a disaster and it's recovering okay guys thank you very much you're welcome the next question comes from sam land from jp morgan please go ahead uh afternoon uh cause i ask i think three questions please first one is on the uh c rate conversion rate that's held up um pretty well but i guess there wasn't very much you know there wasn't any benefit from e-touch in that segment so just be interested in you know did you do any specific cost savings programs in c rate or what what helped the conversion rate in the quarter um second question is on i think there was fifty seven million of uh employee government support in the quarter could you just talk about roughly which which divisions i came in was it mostly in contract logistics um could you see that support be withdrawn um before the market recovered back up to normal rates so there's basically a lag um and your your profitability is impacted by that uh and the last question would just be an update on um on m and a plans of super the dividend should be read into that that um any m and a ambitions or a bit a bit less than a short run or or you still have plenty of five thoughts or look at that thank you okay awesome uh by the way guys you can also ask less then three questions it's not a standard routine that you have to ask three questions only as a as a as a short hit to you so see uh we have cost savings in place and there's no e-touch yet because as many many times the pre-requisite is the fully deployed new transport management system called <unk> uh as a basis for running seal logistics uh e-touch activities in sea logistics the government uh that you allude to eighty eighty five percent is related to contract logistics but people were out of work so as volumes are coming back also in the normal operation people are an employment and we pay them so that's not the point we avoided tool lay of people which is beneficial for our staff and also for for the government related to this so the business the operational run rate of contract logistics has been extremely strong other restructuring may just shorter desired effects and we will see in the second semester when things are cleaning up more and more especially in the quarter four figures how strong contract logistics will will phoenix like come back out of all the restructuring and your question related to m and a ambition i'm a bit surprised because our um proposal dividend proposal has not changed to the one that we made prior to covid nineteen so when we posted our annual results two thousand nineteen there was a divided proposal of first risk thanks per share and cautious as we are we postponed a decision on this and did not decide on a dividend given unsecurity unpredictability of the pandemic and now as we see that cash flow is strong and we weather the situation strongly uh we are we are uh in a situation that uh the board of directors decided to propose for the uh general to propose the same dividend again for the general assembly our m and a ambition ambition our m and a strategy has not changed at all but physical beatings in asia are restricted at the moment so whatever we do is based on video calls okay i'm good thank you you're welcome the next question is come from mark <unk> from <unk> please go ahead hello mark mark hello hello you were short mindset less than three questions yeah i know i'm thinking that it's not that i'm gonna get asked two questions you'll be pleased to hear okay really just just for variety really so just just to come back on um on the every and capacity question could you give us a sense for how much of your air freight in q2 went in freighters rather than uh belly hold and and do you see that changing significantly in certainly in q3 and maybe even in q4 cause my sense is that you know the airlines are bringing back q4 cause my sense is that you know the airlines are bringing back uh capacity but much more of it is short and medium hole um rather than the longer stuff which is typically what you exactly so whatever belly comes back at the moment it's short and medium hall and that doesn't help us i mean usually that is not where we where we and transact the majority of our business yeah so i would expect in the second semester uh sixty to seventy percent of our volume to be transported with freighters main deck capacity yeah and uh belly will not recover to soon i would say it would take maybe two years uh that we see a significant uh network uh activity which allows uh for belly uh using belly capacity again yeah um i don't and that is that is what yeah go ahead sorry the the sixty to seventy percent that you think is gonna go in phrases in the second half would compared to what ninety ninety five percent in q2 because there was so many for better capacity around yeah i'm not sure so this this is oh it's no no mark i'm not sure end of this year we will have sixty to seventy percent uh of the belly capacity that should be back but we will still rely we will still rely on freight capacity to to a major major extent and that will gradually transform or change throughout quarter three and quarter four so we are talking end of the year whether at the moment at the moment i think it's ninety per said if i'm not mistaken or a quarter early quarter two middle of quarter two the majority almost all is rate of capacity so we have a lot of um uh belly still in north america or the americas which can used uh and we used partially uh better capacity for perishables uh out of uh african countries yeah so so when you talk about the gp normalizing or coming back towards the longer term range that's much more the mix cause i guess the light for like gpd from using a freighter isn't gonna be different in august than it was in april particularly right absolutely yeah it's the mix period yeah okay and and the the the second question is straightforward one could you just remind us where you stand on sort of credit insurance on the um on on deaths how much you use it thanks <unk> i got a question once it's so uh <unk> but <unk> is uh a very interesting topic right now uh and without uh disclosing too much details you noted we work with uh the two main crazy insurance uh on a global basis uh a lot of conversations going on right now um i don't wanna say that insurers have all uh similar patterns of obviously when uh when uh business goes well there's a lot of insurance coverage available when business goes not so well it goes down very quickly but we are we are having a good partnership with them and uh and we try to manage as much uh coverage as possible as i said in my presentation until now no significant uh default or fallout or bankruptcy or anything like that however there is uh you know the horizon is a bit darker than what it usually looks like so there's a lot of caution is going forward um how much we pay you can see that of the of the annual uh report we pay every year around three and a half to four million on insurance premium uh i think that is given our sales letter of uh more than three billion a reasonable number when you uh as you around seventy percent of that is being covered yeah and and but but broadly as you go into the second half your level of cover is unchanged yeah our level of cover is uh on a total number are probably unchanged uh when you're looking to some of the industries uh it may vary like aerospace industry might actually be reduced a little bit some industries will be increased but overall the risk profile is shifting within the industries but overall remains very stable okay lovely thank you both very much yeah you're welcome the next question <unk> from <unk> please go ahead hello hello um so neil from credit sweets uh if i can ask firstly uh another question of marcus it's uh if that works as you give you another opportunity it's marcus it's uh if that works as you give you another opportunity thank you much appreciate it my pleasure and then i'll have one for that last two if i may um keep it to two so so the first one marcus you obviously um spent some time talking about working capital and increasing risk to some of your sme customers just wondering uh as it pertains to sea rate uh and the negative mix effect on gp portoy as you plan beyond twenty twenty do you plan for a smaller proportion of sme's relative to normal or how do you think about that as it relates to gp report over the medium term um and then the second question and i guess it could be for either of you just following on from the airlog comments on how it's evolving and obviously sealog is to come how relevant is this to your m and a ambitions that you obviously outlined to an extent of the full year i guess on one hand optimization of those two tms might be ideal before any major transaction but is that the way you think about or is that something that will ultimately take care of itself if you find the right deal in advance okay maybe neil take the letter question if you if you don't mind um first of all we concentrate on our own business and optimizing our own business based on airlock and followed by sealog uh and the e-touch ability of that business uh make e-touch happen and and we make progress here we are uh in in air logistics as we as we have pronounced uh um m and a is independent of this this needs cultural fit looking for access to certain asian customers uh a solutioning that is not yet part of our own solutioning maybe so there are a lot of other criteria and yet uh it would be much easier to transfer a acquisition directly on <unk> to to name this then on our current legacy system but if that would be needed we can do so as well i mean we have proven this is not a big exercise as far as uh so that is not a criteria that would influence our m and a approach or uh delay any m and a it's more um getting acquaed into those separate uh targets and also building up a is of trust and that needs physical personal meetings and you can't do this why uh why uh video calls we also we always said when we announced this because there were rumors in the market we always said it's a two years exercise it doesn't happen over uh but we made progress we never stopped we didn't change approach so from that point of view and quite confident that eventually uh we will be able to announce the right or the right acquisitions uh sonia then uh on the first question i think it's interesting angle that you come from when they're working capital under risk profile to the sme uh i i think we see now the sme's volumes coming down into in the second court just for simple reasons because most of the businesses have been uh due to the curfews have been have been just shut uh uh that doesn't mainly reopen again so i think uh what we are looking at in <unk> is that temporarily there is gonna be um uh a shift in makes away from the sme but i think ultimately is is is are gonna be a bigger portion you know uh we can have an extremely when when you look at the the market share it's a very small market share recover right now so it's it's an absolute attractive and we are totally committed as you know in our customer base to sme customer this is this is our backbone of our operation right um uh there is still a massive potential to grow in uh in in the in a very profitable market in the sme so um how do we arching is gonna look like uh i i think also here there is a time that we need to look at for the normalization but there there is no systemic structural reason why the marching for sme should have uh uh should uh should be lower than it has been in the past so i think uh uh rightfully so uh uh our our backbone sme customer base we will even get a bigger portion of that and the profitability is gonna be run exactly if not the best level that we had until now understood many times first for you the next question comes from <unk> from <unk> please go ahead thank you very much good afternoon um also a question regarding the mix shift in c towards sme um could you could you try and um describe how much of a shift in the mix you saw and what was the effect on the yield that you saw in the c business i think those details we were not as close but the majority of the smb smb business has not been the majority of the smb m e business has not been able to sustain their operations their business models throughout the pandemic at least for four six weeks and that has caused the reduction so um but we see them gradually coming back but as marcus said before some of them do not come back at all because their basis they're they're they're financial seminars it's not given yeah uh and sme is everything the careful it's uh it's also very niche product uh that has not seen an increase in demand at the moment uh whether you have hand painted tiles uh that are produced in northern italy and the demand is coming back now in denmark for example is a rather question of the fronts and and that is maybe how you should think about it but eventually that will come back and our business is and we are strong in smb business our business is uh towards sme so that gives you a bit of a flavor it's it's a result of the pandemic and not of a um how is a conscious mixed decision no i understand okay and the second question final question is around the m and a market and whether uh the trump i mean you mentioned that you are winning market gaining market shares and those that are losing it are typically the smaller mid-sized competitors that are having difficulties on the technology front connectivity and so on and and and you also talk about um credit risks uh escalating so there might be an uptick in the m and a opportunities that you see uh maybe you can talk about that yeah we money for the market for many years and uh we are we are active in the market as you know but not everything that looks shiny is of interest for us and and that maybe we we to fulfill our strategic targets and to continue our gross paths that we have embarked on many years ago we don't need mna what we we have defined targets what we want to achieve with an mna approach and if we find targets that are um fulfilling those requirements we will be active we will become active and if not we don't so and for us the market has not significantly changed at the moment uh and we never looked at we always looked at time also in the past that were successful in their with their business model in their geography geography or in their solutioning we are not looking for a restructuring case that's not our business okay understood thank you very much thank you and thanks the next question comes from christian <unk> from by the bank please go ahead um yes hello i have some more technical questions uh one is uh concerning the decision concerning capex so long term leases so we have seen an increase in the appreciation of right of uh deprivation of right of used assets from two hundred thirty seven to two hundred fifty four um in a second quarter this year and so what is the is the trigger for a decision going for capex or for long-term leases and how is the current market for long-term leases developing so what does the main trigger for any decision in either way second one is uh you are talking and of course there is zero pressure uh are you currently supporting some of your customers uh so for longer payment terms or something like that to keep them into your network and the last one is uh getting you give us a guidance for any kind of income from this poses and the second half thank you uh uh christian <unk> <unk> is asking uh i think your question has uh two answers the first one is uh what is the decision making reasons to it and the second one is what is uh the increase uh in the second quarter uh there are there are two different there are two different reasons to that uh the maybe the more technical first you know that we have uh the asset health for sale related to the disposal of the business in the uk which also includes right a few assets and as per the irs standards you have to stop appreciations uh uh at the point of signing and then uh keep that frozen if you like until uh the of closing that is the that is the simple reason why you have the variances in the second quarter and continue to have until closing has been uh has been a connected so that is the technical part then the the question around uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the other parent uh uh what makes us uh deciding into one or the other pace um main main and most important piece to it is uh is that because we talk most of it of locations right of country logistics facilities right so what is the what is the perspective of that country logistics facility is that a facility that is an operational optimal position then then obviously we on a keep our flexibility most of the time back to back with customers where we say we have a five or i dunno ten years customer contract you know i'm just making an example and we match that with our least commitment it's flexibility that is that is uh that is driving our asset life business model right so uh if you ask us you know then uh each answer is gonna be the more flexible the better we only make investment is issues where where locations do not provide the required quality of facility i give you one example a few years back we were investing into a pharma hub in singapore because there was no such pharma space available right so with a couple of ups and downs uh you know right now it it it became a very uh a very good decision you know in the in the current circumstances to have that space available so but uh this is really the exception where there is a good is why to invest our own money in in in all the other cases uh uh at least um uh agreement back to back with the customer a little bit preferable dso second question dso we never sell on payment terms we don't this is here respectively of any pressure demand or anything like that we sell because we have a very good service we are fully operational we are competitive in the market we are not we are not selling on terms okay that's good and the last one i didn't write down the last one okay that makes long family okay and if you come from disposals oh income from disposals in the first half oh in the second half they call it in the second half uh i will be uh we have a second um we have a second real estate portfolio is out for sale i do not expect material uh impact on the pnl out of that so it's gonna be less than ten million okay thank you very thank you next question comes from <unk> from bank of america please go ahead hi um okay is it possible for you to uh quantify the benefit from newer patients in air gp into q as well as the impact on values from a little perishability as that normalizes how we should be thinking about it in in three q and the second half of the year um and then second we rush you've seen from the digital forwarders during the covid crisis and have you seen a higher or more presence from them during the crisis okay let me let me answer your question okay okay uh the the the letter question i don't know what digital forward is uh but uh i would believe our digital solutions got a lot of pick up during the crisis we have not seen many of our competitors in general being active or aggressive in the market i would say a handful have been the rest somehow disappeared and i'm not exaggerating so um i will not uh name any and i will not uh give any comments on on single forwards um the quantification of the benefits from powership is first of our powership is uh uh low uh low margin uh business and we had uh less perishables uh uh one third less approximately volume one third less perishables in the first semester that led to the cargo mix to a higher year independent on whether charter was available or required or the rate spike or not um we believe that this perishable volume comes back regularly in the second semester and there's that's the mix what reinstate um with a lower year so the seventy to eighty five uh swiss french partner kilo uh will become uh uh reality also uh because of the cargo mix was one third of our total are you being being a person i hope that helps i hope that helps thank you you're welcome the last question comes from <unk> from ubs please go ahead hello i got two questions the first one would be on a contract logistics you mentioned there your cost your expenses came down quite a bit i was wondering if you can add more <unk> how the different cost items i personal costs and the other one sgna have contributed to this development in the second quarter and um the other question i have okay correctly your conversion ratio in particular in asia was quite high in the second quarter is that mainly a function of the transport mode exposure of that region so the last year first of all uh we don't look at conversion rates per region because uh it depends on the terms our customers apply on where to uh you know invoice and and pay uh transport bills uh so it's huge be careful um we have a we have a profit sharing models or that is within our internally between region so that will not really help um the conversion rate for sure is influenced by uh the performance of the different business units and yes in quarter two uh afraid or allergistic has been extremely successful um the uh the question on contractor logistics and cost development the majority of the cost is people colleagues and uh the second cost factor is lease i gave an answer on the lease already because fifty percent or bit more of our contracts are all back to back we dedicated with single customers so the fixed cost coverage is usually part of our contracts uh so that is not an exposure and the rest is uh capacity and we east um was the volume very well yes we did not have a mass layoff and we stated so many times it's not necessary because from the beginning of the pandemic we said this would be in a situation that would that is limited by time uh it would not uh end up in a in a permanent situation and that is exactly what we see many of the operations back i mentioned that only twelve operations out of more than six hundred contract logistic sites as still lock down and eleven out of them are in one country because some infrastructures have not opened yet and the rest is fully operational or had started to become operational again maybe not a three shift operational week but if you look into china and china is maybe a um we can learn from china or asia because they went through this pandemic very early and and gradually uh we have full employment in our of operations in china uh we have uh additional shifts introduced in our line feeding automotive production line uh services spare part services and we see uh increasing and strong demand for a lot of goods uh out of china and uh therefore uh we see that a lot of our customers uh start picking up in volume again is is this v t w o or whatever uh letter forget it but it's not as fast as we thought but the slump was not as severe as we anticipated before us but so i hope that helps to answer your question it's um personal cost is the main factor and we are almost in full employment again in contract logistics that means we have a gross profit related to that activity and um the rest is least cost and uh our idle capacity has not changed significantly uh we have below three percent in either capacity that's uh a leading indicator in our industry perfect thank you <unk> gentleman that we'll send question thank you zanda ladies and gentleman logistics is people business and we are proud of our people they have managed this crisis extremely well and we are honored by our customers their loyalty and their uh business that they awarded to us during the last especially last quarter um we will see how we progress over the next quarter quarter three and we are looking forward to talking to you again uh middle of october and in the meantime stay healthy uh don't travel too much uh don't forget to use masks because we need you as end consumers like millions and billions of others because end consumers drive our business model and we wanna see a strong quarter three um when we talk next thank you very much and talk to you again soon have a nice summer all right and talk to you again soon have a nice <unk> this is gentlemen the conference is now over thank you for choosing calls call and thank you for participating in the conference you may not disconnect your lines good
