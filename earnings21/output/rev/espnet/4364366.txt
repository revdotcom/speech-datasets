forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission we will also be presenting certain non gap financial majors our second quarter press release and performance data attached as exhibits to yesterday form ak violence as well as our commentary on the quarter posted to our website also contain improve important on these non gap majors now i'd like to turn the call over to jack good morning thank you for joining us today i'll start with very brief comments then we'll get straight on to your questions this is a very good quarter from jose and our momentum is increasing the key points about our performance are our cash flow generation this quarter is the result of the past five years of work by our team to transform our cost structure and strength in our franchise we're succeeding even earlier than we expected we've already achieved five of our seven twenty twenty one cost targets even with realized podcast prices down twenty dollars per time from the first quarter and real i saw site prices up just thirteen dollars per time in the quarter we generated over eight hundred million in cash for operations we delivered adjusted ebitda twenty five percent higher than consensus expectations even before our adjusted ebitda definite can change we paid down five hundred million dollars in short term debt and structured payables in the quarter while retaining cash on the balance sheet above one billion dollars in cash we continue to invest in the accelerated case project hitting a major milestone of connecting the k three shops to the k one mill we continue to reduce our brian management costs and we achieved the lowest cash cost per ton of production in over a decade mosaic <unk> had an excellent quarter hitting both real based cost targets and achieving further cost benefits from the weekend realm as well as realizing over eighty percent of our targeted full year transformation benefits states drove the cash costs of rock below the target and lower than last year despite increasing distances from mining to beneficiation and with all of these efforts we've returned our commitment to you to our shareholders our employee our customers and our communities to act responsibly we announce new aggressive broad-based environmental social and governance targets and we will use these targets to drive performance across the business we are continuing trends form recorders accelerating earnings and cash flow clearly reflect our efforts today and we are driving additional future savings we expect to deliver another seven hundred million in savings above the twenty nineteen base at as we continue to execute our strategy mosaic is more competitive than ever before and with fertilizer markets improving we have significant earnings leverage to the future now we'll take your questions i'm gonna start with some questions you received on cost adam samuelson from goldman sachs asked in the second quarter of <unk> was ahead of its twenty twenty one targets and a number of the key cost kpis how much incremental opportunity on each key metric to further reduce costs and if so what level of incremental capital spend would be necessary to achieve those outcomes thanks for your question adam as we've said earlier we have new targets that include seven hundred million of additional improvements across the company two hundred million of those coming from our brazil operations and five hundred coming from our north american and administrative some of the areas where we believe we can make big games as we go forward obviously or in brazil where we continue to improve that business in north america where automation is allowing us to drive efficiencies in both faucets and and potash and then of course our k three operation which as we ramp it up will eliminate a lot of costs and improve our grind management costs so as we look forward we see a lot of opportunities still and importantly in september when we bring our all of this to our analyst day we expect to be able to give you more color and detail on what that's gonna look like jack chris parkinson from credit swift asked you're clearly comfortably ahead on numerous costs initiatives including your k three shafts brian info plus state rock costs in the us in brazil and for the <unk> platform but would you take a step back how are you thinking about your structural cost base in a normalized environment and how much more could actually be done especially in cost yeah thank you chris it's important to keep in mind these cost improvements certainly are somewhat driven by high utilization we've had a good quarter where we're able to use our assets fully and we've had some benefits from exchange rate particularly in brazil but also in canada over the long term though the real differences have been structural and those are gonna stay with us and those are gonna continue and we're going to continue to improve those so if we look at you know our major projects which include s a k three next gen mining and the brazil transformation those are not temporary differences those are true structural changes that will be delivering value for the long term josh michael piken from cleveland research app you mentioned that you were on track to exceed your two hundred twenty five million in non-market growth in twenty twenty which segments are exceeding your expectations and how much higher can this number go for twenty twenty hello michael let me clarify our two hundred twenty five million were actual items that we spent in twenty nineteen that we did not expect to repeat in twenty twenty so on those some of the key items the plant city idling that's happened and now is outside of our cost structure our brazilian downs we completed the work now and that eighty million of cost is now behind us for equally the ramp up of ester hazy which has gone better than we expected we now are delivering one million tons a year from the k3 project so that benefit has already flowed through to us and then of our fifty million dollars of transformation in brazil that we're part of that two hundred twenty five million we're already at over forty million so we see that as pretty much complete and ongoing savings will be above and beyond that original two twenty five as possible that's a larger number of questions take a better understanding of our countervailing duties petition that's all seen from morningside chris parkinson from credit twist to ask for an update on potential regulation changes of the us import duties on morocco and russia supply and if the outcome is successful in our favors what should they expect in changes to their landed us costs in other words what of the potential outcomes in terms of leveling the playing field thank you gentlemen let me start by saying we believe in free and fair trade however the reason we filed this petition in the first place was to address and balances associated with unfair government subsidies on inputs and to highlight unequal requirements on environmental standards we believe our competitors benefit from access to artificially low rock costs and energy will not having to meet adequate and proper environmental standards we also will say that what we have done is put this forward to the department of commerce and the international trade commission they will judge on the merits and as such determine what level of duties if any need to be put in place to create a fair trade situation and clint do you have anything to yeah no john i think you're right we uh we certainly are ahead of schedule on the realization of the two hundred twenty five million dollars in non-market benefit this year you know keep in mind that um eighty million that we spent on them or mediation last year uh was spread really through the second through fourth quarter so we realized about thirty six million dollars in benefit in the second quarter and should realize the balance uh throughout the rest of the year john john roberts from ubs would like to know can you review the basis for your state's kind of really in duties position and have you had any response from customers or competitors thank you john our basis for the petition is clearly laid out in the public documents and i would ask that you go to those also the comments from any of our competitors for uh customers or the other concern groups is clearly laid out in those public documents so i would suggest you go there our position is clearly the department of commerce and the international trade commission really are the ones that will to see what are the merits of this case now clearly as we talk to our customers some are concerned mostly about how they're going to get their supply we believe that this has opened up new opportunities for us side competitors to come in and make up some of that supply um but in the end i think all people understand why we put it forward and you know we'll have to wait to see what the itc says in terms of his mayor we received several questions asking about trade flows and implications to other markets specifically adam samuelson and seven others over the next six to twelve months how do we think about the net impact of potential trade flow impact of potential us countervailing duties on morocco and russian states do you see risks of market share competition rising in other major import markets notably brazil thanks mike and joel let's answer the last question first no we don't think this will impact global supply and demand all we will do is probably change trade flow the current market and resulting pricing is reflective of a tight market and if anything the countervailing duties only highlighted to people that this market was tight so what's causing the tight market favorable farm economics and lower supply which began to take shape all before we file the petition however it is reasonable to assume that the trade flows will be altered and some product will be shifted to other jurisdictions including new suppliers coming into the us and the morocco and we suppliers focusing on other markets which could be brazil or wherever jonas oscar from bernstein asked two more technical questions with respect to the petition namely if the mosaic trade complaint is upheld will there be a retroactive benefit to mosaic and what is the timeline for final decision on the complaint so let thank you join us let me for clarify whether duties are applied retroactively will depend upon the level of imports from these two countries from the filing of the case until the doc preliminary ruling we expect the case to be finalized in q one twenty twenty one and at that point if there has been excessive imports they will look at assessing a retroactive duty jack i'm now gonna move on to questions about prostate operations then <unk> from social asks on the cash cost of mind drop and port of fall into thirty six dollars per ton from forty dollars year over year how much of that would due to transformational efforts versus favorable geology and how much more wiggle room is there to bring that down and how sustainable are these cost improvements thank you then clearly our cost improvements are combination of several factors we've certainly been running our assets at a elevated utilization rates and that's helped but our efforts to centralize mining operations streamline processes and automate have also helped reduce our cost as previously mentioned the establishment of a central control center for our mining and collapsing all of our mining operations basically into one large operation which should be begin operation by the end of the year will really further enhance cost safe and as we introduce new management structures incorporate automation for certain mining functions and accelerate savings from adjustments to transportation we start to see real long-term improvements in our cost structure south pj juvacar for the city also asked with the recent rise of over fifty dollars per time in d a t pricing have you ramped up your production at the mine and what could be the benefit a better cost subscription from higher times in the third quarter thanks for the question pj high utilization rates have a beneficial impact but that's really only part of the story as we've mentioned but i will say that as we look at two three going forward we can expect those tonage high tonage and high utilization rates to continue so we do expect to see better costs throughout the rest of the year both structurally and because of utilization staff we also have a question from adam samuelson from goldman's tasks the specialty percentage drove to forty eight percent of shipments and marked a new quarterly high in philosophy collision it was micro essential shipments to <unk> being substantially above recent quarters is this sustainable why or why not thank you adam the sales of micro essentials and aspire hit record highs and kmeg came in close to the record in quarter two to twenty twenty among these grows microcentral shipments to brazil has been a major driver now we believe that the growth of micro essentials will continue over the next quarter driven by mosa <unk> and also north america i have to reemphasize the value that micro essentials brings to the growers is showing positive returns for them on their investments so these are bringing real value to the growers and to our customers of the distributors so we do believe that as more people start using micro essentials this is very sustainable and they're going to see the benefit and they're going to keep using that product so three analysts submitted most i part questions related to our potash operations so first chris parkinson's f the demand environment in potash appears to be modestly improving while spot prices are well off their first half load can you talk about your thought process for the second half of twenty one operating rate assumptions and how that may drive changes in your mindness thanks chris as you know we've accelerated the development of k three and has an obvious impact on cost both now with declining brian management spending and in the future as the mine ramps up beyond k three we continue to see strong results from bell plane which recorded as lowest cost position in are gonna decade as we move forward we're going to take advantage of only two of only seven lines in the world with annual production capacity of over three million thomas and with some of the lowest costs in the industry so as we look to the future we intend to optimize the production coming from k3 and from our bell plane operation and only see running higher cost minds like <unk> if the market really requires it in the future okay that's another question comes to you from jonas oxfords of bernstein uh in pot as you lowered your cost per ton of fair bit but how much of that was simply spreading fixed cost over a twenty percent larger volume on a fixed volume basis what would your cost reduction be good question jonas there is no question that the larger volume helps spread out our costs however we believe there are structural changes that are fundamentally change our costs over the long term we think one area of clear savings is the accelerated reduction of brian management costs we shift to k three k one underground mining will be completed this year brian management accounted for eight dollars a ton in q2 and that will continue to decline as we move into twenty twenty one and we'll be eliminated completely by twenty twenty two so as you can see a lot of our cost reduction is actually structural and should be with us for the longterm <unk> <unk> from city a what kind of savings do you expect from sending k three <unk> to the k one mill and what is the updated timeline now to shut down k one and k two thank you j we expect to be sending potash to k one and actually be shutting down our k one shaft from a production perspective early in twenty twenty one that will start meaning we're only going to be operate in two shows and then by the end of twenty twenty two only operating the one big k three show at that point the project will be complete will eliminate brian inflow and that really will be the end of our k one nk two plan um mine's from a production perspective now since and andrews it's interested in how he should think about our podcast shipments in the second half of this year given how strong shipments were in second quarter all and we remind him of the accounting for the chinese contract shipments that were already in a bonded warehouse prior to contract agreement thank you vincent yes we did have strong shipments in quarter one on and if i refer to our discussions with camp techs i think they have a fairly full order book for q3 and even going well into q4 so i believe the shipments internationally will be strong in the second half and dement typically we're expecting a good fall in north america so we're expecting strong shipments there as well so from our perspective a second half is looking pretty strong from a podcast perspective in terms of the shipments in first half i i just like to throw it over to clint to explain a little bit about uh our china shipments to bonded warehouse that we revrecked in the first half of the year clint can you discuss that sure john good morning vincent um so to start with um on a consolidated basis we don't recognize revenue until that product is sold to a third party however um we do on a second a level basis we do recognize a revenue when uh campitects sells um product to our distribution business in china and when they sent that product to our distribution business in china the segment recognized revenue but that was based on an estimate of pricing since the contract had not been completed once the contract was completed and the price for that transaction was set that gave rise to the adjustment but again that's an adjustment on the potash segment only because we won't recognize revenue on that product on a consolidated basis until it's finally sold to a third party thanks for that clarification question jack i'm not gonna move on to questions about <unk> we have four analysts including john roberts from ubs mark conley from stevens asked similar questions about the timing of values in brazil brazilian farmers are having an outstanding year so far and have been widely reported to the buying inputs well ahead of last year schedule how much do you say has been borrowed from the third quarter and are we likely to see an offsetting reduction in third quarter margin to reflect those lower values next quarter and specifically within the quarter april and may were significantly higher than the prior year month while due appear to be much closer to a year ago is that just timing or are the trends decelerating into july great question the strong volumes in the first half of the year did reflect some forward input purchases as a result of generally favorable farm economics but year over year demand is expected to be up slightly the thirty seven million tons and in that figure we believe we are beginning to take market share as farmers gravitate towards higher analysis products and high value products such as our micro essentials josh mark conley at stevens asked how did the dramatic improvement in cost in brazil break out between volume driven cost improvement and operational structural cost change that should repeat with normal volumes thank you mark let me start by saying last year operations were negatively impacted by the changing regulations that required us to shut down a couple of operations for dam improvements that reduced volume and impacted our raw materials access this year we're we're benefiting for running at full operations rates and this also has allowed us to have more access to our own rock supply so overall that has helped a little bit so about a third of those costs are probably volume related to others are improvements to our freight our inventory management our overall planning and of course structural changes to our to our cost structures i think overall though we're we're seeing a long term change just to how the brazil business is running and we're starting to see full benefit of the three hundred and thirty million dollars or so of integration benefit that we announced at the end of last year <unk> has a question about currency the brazilian rei versus the usl and we found significantly year over year in the second quarter of twenty twenty how did that volatility impact you and what specifically was the impact in the quarter on <unk> thanks pj i'd like to talk about two aspects of the um brazilian rei that really has changed things and the first of those of course is the impact on farm economics i think that is actually the big improvement their ability to buy fertilizers and the continuous growth of the brazilian agriculture segment is largely driven by great economics for the farmer and so you know that's the first place we want to talk about where the brazilian rei has helped us in terms of our cost performance you will see that we tend to put our targets in rei base so that allows us to understand what's the real underlying improvement uh obviously there was some positive impact uh i think we saw definite improvements in our overall cost because of the ui but i would say we focus more on what is the rei based cost because that tells us whether we're really improving the business or just taking advantage of currency well in the back you'll notice sorry pj i'd also like to point out that if you look at the back commercial stuff you'll see basically our sensitivities and a one a ten cent move in the rei amounts to about twenty million dollars a year unhinged so if we think about us as being about fifty percent hedge uh it's fairly easy to do uh the reconciliation to last year's rei costs jeff we have another question from ben <unk> um with respect to <unk> <unk> sales volumes have been notably higher year over year can you walk through the strategic strength of this business and how it relates to your mix between commodity and micro central tons thanks ben you know again i've said this before but i'll i'll repeat you know the the volume growth really was a result of improvement in farm economics in brazil uh the strengthening of the us dollar versus the korea excellent barbara ratios and anticipation of a a strong summer crop demand so both both commodity and performance products have shown robust increases in punit quarter two of twenty twenty versus a year ago so chris parkinson asked for a covid nineteen update his question is brazil is in the midst of a fairly complex covid nineteen outbreak which has periodically been affecting the port and logistics system can you give us an update on the demand environment as well as any logistical headwinds you perceive during the peak fertilizer application season thanks chris look let's start from our home for operations in brazil and all the we've had a number of cases because of the high level of community transmission we have not been impacted on our operations to this point and we've instituted a number of procedures to make sure we mitigate the spread sorry and then from an overall country logistics perspective we believe that in general we have been unaffected by of it now obviously there's going to be local places where that impacts us but in general we've been able to work around that and kept the product moving to the end customer and from a and perspective despite covid we continue to see strong demand again driven by favorable farm economics and we have got our product to our customers with relatively little impact the last question we received them <unk> comes from joel <unk> second quarter growth margin was more than doubled the results from the prior two years how much of that game was market conditions versus foreign exchange tailwind versus share game in the market versus a pull forward of q3 because of covid related logistics concerns thanks joel i would summarize our results in the second quarter of in brazil as a couple of factors first of all if we looked at the exchange rate it's probably offset almost perfectly the change in pricing so what we see in actual results is almost solely the result of our own actions and the reversal of some of the dam costs that we saw last year josh we received a handful of questions on the balance sheet primarily focused on uses of free cash flow john roberts asked what are the capital allocation priorities moving forward and can you please discuss your growth that level dividend and potential share with purchases and tj <unk> asked beyond paying down some debt what could be uses of cash especially with improved pre-cash flow in the second half of twenty twenty would buy back the improved use of cash over the counter really duty decision prevent you from buying back stock josh can you talk about capital priorities to address both of these questions yeah thank you gentlemen our capital priorities are unc changed and they continue to be what we've said in the past our you know our first priority is to maintain the business uh next priority maintain investment grade metrics and to do that uh you know we have to continue our normal capital plan as we have uh we expect to lower debt by about a billion dollars over the next few years uh doing so when our bonds come do in the next couple of years and then continue some of the key projects like the ester hazy acceleration k2 acceleration and then what we have after that returning capital to shareholders also really are dependent on future cash flow generation and capital allocation will not be impacted in any way by the countervailing duties we want so i have a couple of questions from a buy side analyst uh and they include um can you describe what's included in the six hundred ten million of short-term debt that you indicated will be paid in twenty twenty and <unk> still plan to keep about a billion our cash balance and paid on its twenty twenty one maturity thanks for the question at the start of this year we did increase our cash balance to a billion dollars by first of all taking out uh some money from our revolver and executing on some of our uh inventory financing debt since that time we pay down the revolver and we will continue to pay down the rest of the six a million dollars in short-term depth throughout the rest of this year before we move on the market related questions then i just asked about our tax rate outlook why is your effective tax rate expected to be in the mid to high fifties and how should we think about this rate under a trump or biden presidency thank you ben let me start by saying the first part of this is and the reason for the tax rate being higher is our income mix between our three jurisdictions canada brazil and the us the details of that i'm gonna actually hand it over to clint to explain why the negative earnings in the us will create a higher tax rate overall yeah thanks jack and um and then that's right it really comes down to an earn mix uh phenomenon for us if you recall the um the tax rate is is is based on gap results by jurisdiction and when you look at the united states not only is our state business uh incorporated into that but also our corporate dna our interest expense and so forth so um there are times when that pretact income in the us turns negative and that can begin to skew the rate when you then start to factor in things like some of the foreign currency moves that we've seen um and how it affects our our market and and some of the notable items that that we have on our schedule that begins to skew it and then you know as you've seen brazil uh improve this year uh that's our highest rate tax jurisdiction so so that uh begins to influence that rate as well so really the combination of all of those things that's resulting in an unusually high tax rate for this year and then i've had two things uh one uh on a longer term basis we would expect that effective tax rate uh to be uh somewhere in the mid to high twenties um but then i would also call your attention um that our cash tax uh rates uh and payments uh are much different than that matter of fact this year we expect to end up with a uh a small cash tax refund um so very different than the uh the effect tax rate in our financial statements now let's move on to market related questions mike pike and ask if you could comment on our summer fill programs in the us and where we see downstream inventories in the us at this point thank you michael i think we've had fairly successful fill programs in both file states and pods here in the us uh recent discussions that we've had with our customers suggest so they're probably in the range of sixty percent full for the fall season so there will be increased mind towards the fall season but that for the most part our customers are in reasonably healthy shape going into that fall <unk> is looking for insight into future volume how are you trending in each of the segments through the month of july on a year over year basis do you see i'm tired in the third quarter and any expectation for volumes for the rest of the year thanks steve i would characterize q3 as largely having our order books full for both fast state and pot ash and so it'll be a matter of delivery and uh revenue recognition that will determine where we are for quarter three but we expect a reasonably good fall in the us and global markets are running well so for both states and potash we expect relatively normal two three volumes in both and then for the rest of the year we should also see a good stable uh volume south mark tom lee would like insight into grain and healthy price implications how important to mosaic's earnings outlook are higher grain and healthy prices if the current price of corn is sustained through twenty twenty and soybeans stay at or near their current prices do you think there is any material room for higher pk prices in the market thank you mark clearly oil seed and grain prices do have implications for us but in general the farmers tend to work a lot more on their needs to plants so what's a lot more important to us is planting intentions number of acres planted and remember also the grain and oil seeds are just a few of the products that we fertilize so it really depends on what does the whole global market look like and what is the demand for pnk and what supply balance there as opposed to something on the grain oil seed it has an indirect impact that i would say no direct impact on our price screen vincent andrews from morgan stanley wants to know about our markets forecast given that the last ten years of p and t shipments show some pattern lumpiness of potash more than proxy why not forecast lumpiness going forward rather than just <unk> thanks vincent we tend to forecast on annual growth simply because some of the other facts that go into the lumpiness of our business are impossible to forecast and those are you know really inventory movements globally and of course weather uh you saw in twenty nineteen the weather impacts in the u that made a fundamental difference to the growth rate of both face and potash on a on a global scale so we really have to look at it on averages but recognize that we will be lumping as we go forward i'm gonna move on to some questions on <unk> this one is from ben <unk> the benchmark m a t selling part sell by sixteen dollars to three hundred fourteen dollars per ton yet mosaic's average finished product selling sites sell by almost three times at amount on by forty four dollars to three oh eight from two fifty two why how could we think this so how should we think about this relationship going forward thanks then the answer here is simply that the average selling price in portal vantage is based on all the components we sell including uria and plot ash the blend both of which are down significantly so when you look at that relationship going forward you have to take into account all three products that could be in our blend that we sell then also ask staff shipping my have started to improve in july after remaining largely fast throughout the second quarter are you seeing this flow through to the fast state segments margin thank you ben again that driving margin is we track that because that really is what do we get after the cost of raw materials and transport as as revenue so of course this flows directly into our margins an improvement in stripping margin really is almost directly related to our overall profitability adam samuelson with a you know and what does <unk> see is the equilibrium prices of u s <unk> d a p and map versus key offshore benchmark thank you adam all i can really say there is if you look at it historically other than the last say three years where there's been a real increase in imports um we have seen nola prices being similar to other global prices and i would expect that under a more fair trade market that's what you would see is you would see the normal price being equal to what a prices and other markets adjusted for the transport cost and that's exactly what we expect will happen after a countervailing duty case if they readjust that market jackie burn would like more insight into our global software demand outlook and its relationship to inventory swings specifically what is your estimate of underlying global consent that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's that's what we look at in twenty nineteen there's no question that there was built up of global inventory particularly in the us i mean in the us there was um a poor season and the imports in particularly kept coming in we shut down our louisiana operation for a number of months last year and and still the inventory build in the us was was very high likewise the brazilian inventory was probably slightly above normal coming into this year for maybe some of the same reasons but what i will say is in the first and second quarter of this year we have largely cleared out all of that inventory and probably have moved from an area of high inventory to a very low inventory in fast states as we move into the third quarter of this year it's a related question he also asked our normalized inventory levels the reason for the increased state shipment forecast in twenty twenty one thanks steve yeah in terms of twenty twenty one what we really see is the inventory levels should be pretty much leveled off and we expect normal growth in the market as per any other year so that two percent type annual growth in twenty twenty one vincent andrews would like our opinion on farmer economics he asked given the recent run up in dap prices are you all concerned about us farmers deferring fall applications thanks vincent look our experience has been and if you look even at the spring with the covid uncertainty that farmers will put fertilizer on their fields according to their needs and you know frankly today with precision agriculture they're more likely to put the right amount of fertilizers on every year so you know and fosse prices frankly also are a very small piece of the overall cost of running a farm so i don't believe that most farmers will look at fosse pricing and have it changed their application but i'd also highlight that faucet prices are still very affordable when you look at where grain and oil seed prices are so as with most fall seasons we would expect that weather will be the main arbitrator of demand and you know with expecting an early crop maturity this year we expect we should have a good fall jack we have to three questions related to china and philosophy first vincent andrews asks what do you anticipate will be the chinese d a p exports in the second half of twenty twenty and what second half twenty twenty that price does that assume the staff prices are higher or lower than your assumption what would happen to chinese i suppose makes sense chinese exports over first half of the year were lower by about eight hundred thousand tons from last year now are they forecast calls for chinese exports to end the year about six hundred thousand tons lower in other words we expect that in international pricing is a little higher we'll send a few extra tons coming out of china in the second half and if prices are higher than expectations um there might be a little bit more upside but we don't see significant upside and part of reason for this is domestic demand is coming in fairly strong as we move into fall and i think the big issue there will be export availability limitations now obviously if our prices are lower than expectations uh um you know the volumes could be even lower than what they are now that's goldstein and steve burn both ask about productions specifically what does the status and outlook for reduced prostate production at specific facilities in china and tomesia and do you expect lower exports over the next several years well let me hit china first um you know there's been a a well known shift towards uh shutting down some of the higher polluting plants particularly along the nc river um and we've seen some here uh that have resulted in production declines in the first half of the year uh in terms of chinese export volume over the next years uh we maintain the chinese exports will trained trend lower and we'll establish a new normal i we've now seen what we think is the bottoming of chinese domestic demand and we're seeing a lowering of production so with that will have to come a lowering of exports as they need domestic demand for tanisha it would appear that expectations for a plant research and resurgence of production in twenty twenty were somewhat overstated but it's also important to put tanisha in context they have produced an average of about seven hundred fifty thousand tons of dap and tsp over the last five years her protests will certainly lead to shuttering of their rock production if this has plugged them for over a decade so which means we would expect them to stay about the same rain rate as we go forward as well john the last section of questions relate to potash global markets at seed bernest fest goldstein asked about the impact of palm oil demand what is the typical lives between movements and palm oil prices and changes in potash demand in southeast asia and has the rebound in palm oil pricing resulted in increased in southeast asia thank you gentlemen the palm oil demand is important for pod ash and what we have seen recently is an improvement in palm oil prices and we know that for production reasons they will be adding potash to their palm oil plantations so so we see that as a fairly direct relationship uh i wouldn't say we see increased demand but we see the and that is getting back to its normal levels in terms of a longer term um export demand and domestic demand for biofuels is helping in terms of optimism for recovery so all of these things mean that we should see a better demand for potash in the southeast asia region particularly malaysia indonesia joe jackson and ben i would both like to understand where global product inventory stand in the various regions particularly in china thank you gentlemen um if if we look at china there's there's sort of a bifurcation of of inventory we know there's about three and a half million tons at the port but we believe there's relatively low inventory as we move in land and so as we're now seeing a strong demand for npks into the market we do expect that the movements out of the port to those npk plans will start bringing down inventory levels assuming that the arrivals are about normal levels compared to last year mark conley and steve burn are both interested in podcast demand group what is driving the acceleration in podcast demand in your podcast they're not there's specific geography thanks i wouldn't say we're actually forecasting an acceleration of potash demand our potash demand growth from a long-term trend is saying fairly study at what we believe to be around three percent and if you take twenty nineteen out of it i think we still stay just on that trend in a related question it's demand ends up toward the high end of your range do you see increased supply balance in the market or would you expect the market to tighten well i guess this is risk there's two things one the success of production rampups on the new projects particularly i guess europe kim's uh <unk> and <unk> um but given the delays we've seen in recent years on these rampups so it would seem that the market should tighten actually if demand comes in and buy into our expectation in the last related question also what is the full case for page pricing over a three to five year period thanks there's a number of uh factors that could create a bull run in potash prices and the first i've already mentioned uh which is slower ramp up of the um projects particularly the ones in russia and bella russia but what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the north american assets over the next say three to five years and and a more modest rise in prices that would suggest prices appreciate slightly to where they were maybe in twenty eighteen and utilization of assets goes up at the same time another product related question from adam samuelson and ben isaacson they're both asking about the disconnect between pricing trends between the million mlp that rallied off flows in the second quarter versus us and southeast asia the mlp prices that have continued to be flowers are strong brazilian economics enough to offset the weakness in other regions thanks brazilian farm economics are really outstanding present which is certainly helping to underpin pricing in that market and we expect that to continue uh for the us and so these asian markets i think it's important that remember that this is a seasonally slow period for potash demand and that will impact prices i'd also like to highlight that our summer fill program was extremely well received and it is typical of commodity markets to necessarily see first a rebound in demand and then prices following after that we have now completed our free submitted questions and so now i would like to do is open it up to the audience for live q and a operate thank you as a reminder to ask a question you will need to press star one on your telephone keep add to your question please press the pound key we will limit the question to one per participant to allow others questions to be addressed thank you please stand by what we compile the january board first question comes from the line of adam <unk> from goldman's acts your line is open uh yes thanks uh good morning everyone so uh i guess i i want to just pull up on on the affordability uh question jock on <unk> and on your own kind of affordability the metric that you published were now uh above long-term average and just trying to think about where where you would see an upper limit to that and especially if you think about next year and farmer income risks um from government support programs in the us or lack thereof given kind of the big farmer support payments that have been experienced both this year and last thanks adam welcome uh you know there's certainly a relationship between uh crop prices and how people feel about the imports but as you say you know support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot to keep farmering at least stable um and yes while we're pushing um five state and partners prices probably not partners much but certainly five states a little bit closer to that um ratio two things on this side say is first of all you gotta look at december twenty one prices and if you look at december twenty one prices i think we um i think we'd be looking at what three sixty and nine three sixty for corn and nine bucks for for um being so they're they're gonna see some reasonable price of on their um if they sold forward into that market so they'd be incentive to get a good crop and and use the fertilizer the in terms of the direct relationship between the two i'd say you could easily go a standard deviation above that ratio and not have it maturely affect demand thank you next question comes from the line of steve burns from bank of america your line is open yeah i just wanted to hear whether or not you saw any impact on falsified courts during during the month of july following the kind of railing uh duty uh petition and just uh asked for an update on your your uh gypsum sales out of the your uh gypsex in brazil any any update on that sure thanks steve um first of all yeah in july i believe the um imports were lower in july i i um i have to get an exact number and get somebody to get back on on how much that was down but our understanding and we we did talk to a lot of customers and our understanding is certainly the um the importers who were importing either the o c p for the russian products i definitely took a step back to understand what the risks might be in terms of um them picking up uh some sort of uh countervailing duty risks so uh we we did see a step back in july whether they will come back into the market in the next couple of months i don't know what we have seen however is new products coming in from places like egypt and australia and mexico so it does say there is some some change uh i gotta have somebody to give me what was the second part of your question there steve i missed the
