our suppliers have backed nearly full output and can and youth to prioritize our production we have also relooked at a considerable amount of our cut and so production to two facilities we work with in vietnam likewise in both our mattress fabrics and home accessories business we are currently experiencing any delays in asia and we also have significant alternative locations for production as needed this includes production or sourcing capabilities in the us canada haiti vietnam and turkey while we cannot predict whether the virus will have any negative impact on consumer confidence in the us consumer market we believe our solid and stable supply chain and our global platform supports our ability to manage any disruption created by the option okay now turn to the third quarter results as previously announced our results for the quarter reflected unexpected sales particularly in our core business segments while several external factors affected our results for the third quarter we believe call is well positioned for the medium and long term our global platform is reactive and is a distinct competitive advantage for the company providing the ability to quickly respond to changing market dynamics we also benefit from significant synergies across our business segments that are fostering collaboration and product development and allow us to better serve our customers in all markets above all we remain focused on innovation and creative designs in all of our busi and we are confident in our product driven strategy and the ability to meet the changing demands of a diverse customer base throughout fiscal twenty twenty we have maintained our position as a trusted supplier of fabrics for a global marketplace importantly we have the financial strength to support and execute our strategies and continue returning funds to our shareholders we look forward to the opportunities ahead for the remainder of fiscal twenty twenty and beyond on our two in the call over to ken who are the financial results for the quarter thank you as mentioned earlier on the call we have posted slide presentations to our investor relations website that cover key performance measures we've also posted our capital allocation strategy here's the financial highlights for the third quarter net sales were seventy two million down six point eight percent compared with the prior year period on a pre-tax gap basis the company reported a net loss of five point one million compared with a pre-tax income of four point three million for the third quarter of last year as previously disclosed a few weeks ago on february eighteenth the results for the third quarter the current fiscal year include a reversal of a six point one main recorded contention earnout liability as well as nine cash impairment charges a thirteen point six million related to the home assessment division resulted in a non-cash net charge of seven point six million excluding this net charge adjusted pre-taxed income non-cap was two point four million for the third a quarter of this fiscal year the financial results for the third quarter of last fiscal year included approximately seven hundred sixty nine thousand in restruction and related charges and credits and other non-recurring items do mostly to the closure of the companies andersons south carolina production facility excluding this net charge pre that income for the third quarter of last year was five million net loss attributed to coke and shareholders was fifty eight thousand dollars or zero cents per diluted share for the third quarter a comparable net income of three point two men or twenty five cents per diluted chair for the prior year period the results of the third quarter of both fiscal years include the respective charges and restructure and related credits i just noted the effect of that camp tax rate was nineteen percent for the third quarter and a hundred forty two point eight percent for the year date period for this fiscal year the company's high effective income tax rate for the year date period reflects the significant decline in the companies per objected annual consolidated taxable income particularly in the us which includes the income tax effects of the asset impairment charge is previously discussed as well as the mix of consolidated taxable income that has earned by the companies foreign operate since located in china and canada that have higher income rates in relation to the us the current mix of taxed income has led to a significant increase in the effective income tax rate that is associated with our global in tangible low tax income or guilty tax which represents a us income tax on foreign earnings importantly income taxes incurred in the us on a cash basis for fiscal twenty twenty are expected to be men will do to the projected utilization of the company's us federal net operating loss period forwards and immediate expenses of us capital expenditures looking ahead to the rest of this fiscal year we estimate that our consolidated effective income tax rate will remain high and be in the a hundred twenty percent a hundred thirty percent range based on the fact we know today and is affected by the factors noted above notably the us treasury department and internal revenue service have issued newly to opposed regulations that if and when enacted and if enacted as proposed could provide us with some relief from the guilty tax under the proposed guilty high tax exception election beginning of fiscal twenty twenty one or later sub you to the timing of enactment and subject to any determination by the us treasure department and irs that the exception should apply retroactive retroactive the proposed guilty tack high-tech exception election is not available to the proposed regulations are finalized and effective if the proposed guilty tax exception election is an access proposed and becomes effective for our fiscal twenty twenty one year and assuming we do not have non-recurring charge or impairments that would reduce our pre-test income then based on current assumptions we would estimate our tax rate for fiscal twenty twenty one did it be in the range of thirty five to fifty percent however let be stressed that there are a lot of moving parts that affect this rate including the many factors i've discussed previously so this estimate could change trailing twelve months of <unk> as of the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year was nineteen point six million or six point seven percent of sales consolidate return on capital for the twelve month period with eight point seven percent now let's take a look at our two at our business segments for the mattress fabric segment sales with thirty three point one man down seven point four percent compared to last year third quarter operating income for the quarter was one point eight man compared with three point two man a year ago with an operating income margin of five point four percent compared with nine percent a year ago the operate performance was primarily affected by lower than expected sales return on capital for the trailing twelve month period for mattress fabrics was fourteen point one percent for the opposed to fabric segment sales for the third quarter were thirty five million down five point seven percent over the prior year which prior year was a strong a very strong quarter sales performance that was possibly affected by advanced customer purchases in anticipation of additional tariffs operating income for the order was three man compared with three point eight man a year ago with auburn income margin of eight point seven percent compared with ten point two percent a year ago we are pleased with the eight point seven percent margin this year given that it was achieved during the quarter with the chinese new year shut down occurred return on capital for the twelve and twelve month period for the post two thousand seven continues to be impressive coming in at fifty four percent the home assessory segment which includes our e-commerce and finished product business offering betting accessories and home goods reported three point nine million sales to the third quarter compared with four point four million a year ago operating officer the quarter was a hundred eighty one thousand which reflects continuous sequential improvement from the three hundred fifty thousand dollar loss experience in the second quarter and the five hundred thirty five thousand dollars loss experience in the first quarter we'll comment more on operating performance later on here the balance sheet highlights we reported thirty four point eight million total cash in investments and outstanding barns nine hundred nine hundred twenty five thousand for a net cash position of thirty three point nine million for the first nine months of this fiscal year we incurred four point one million capital expenditures we returned four point five minutes to shareholders and regular reported dividends and sherry purchases us through the third quarter of this fiscal year we had negative cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of five hundred nineteen thousand and four point seven main respectively for the first month so this fiscal year due primarily to the timing of payments in advance of chinese new year setdowns and highly expected inventory mostly in our mattress fabrics business this compared with positive cash flow from operations and positive pre-cash flow of eight point one man and five point nine million respectively for the prior year period with better working capital performance including better management of inventory we expect cash flow of operations and free cash flow to improve significantly in the fourth quarter this this year the company we purchased fifty six thousand shares of our common stock during the third four of this year and we purchased approximately eighty six thousand additional shares through march fourth leaving three point three men available under the previous shared with purchase program as reported in our press release our board has approved and increased our shared purchase organization back to five million shares may be purchased at the company's discretion from time to time in the open market or in properly negotiated transactions we will continue to consider opportunities to refresh the shares at a price to reflect a discount to our calculated intrinsic value for share however as highlighted in our capital allocation strategy which is posted in the investor relations section of our website we remain focused on a very disciplined approach to capital allocation including maintaining a strong balance sheet and solid cash position particularly given the current uncertainty in the global business and by with that i'll turn the call back over to you thanks ken let me start with the mattress fabric segment our mattress fabric sales were lower than anticipated for the third quarter of the year as we were pressured by more than expected or we of pressure more than expected from holiday shutdowns and continued industry weakness for our legacy business customers mattress covers have become an increasingly important part of our business and losing multiple productive weeks for our class cover operations in haiti and also in china cost a more significant impact when combined with softness and our legacy business also the anti-dumping measures relating to low price mattress imports from china have not yet provided the relief expected for the domestic mattress industry in spite of these challenges we continue to manage our business with a relentless focus on creative designs innovative products and exceptional service our global platform supports these efforts with efficient production and distribution capabilities to provide a full of compliment of mattress fabrics and some covers with the flexibility to adapt to evolving customer needs we are strengthened by our existing manufacturing operations in the us canada haiti china and our sourcing platform form in turkey we expect to add fabric production capabilities in vietnam this calendar year and we're also expanding our stone cover production capabilities in haiti with a new building and additional equipment we believe these expansions on hay us our abilities to serve customers further while the domestic disruption from low price mattress imports appears to be continuing as a result of many imports moving from china now to other countries we believe our strong global platform for fabric and covers in asia has us well positioned to capture market share with important mattresses going forward additionally while the holiday shutdowns disrupted our class operations in haiti and china during the third quarter we are pleased with a continued growth of our son mattress cover business demand trends for mattress covers remains favorable especially for the growing box betting space and we continue to develop fresh products with both new and existing customers with some cover production capabilities now in the us haiti and asia we have a very strong platform that allows us to maximize our full supply chain potential from fabric to finished covers we continue to invest in design and marketing capabilities with our latest technologies improve the customer experience and speed to market with new digital tools and project management software we are very pleased with initial customer response to our new 3d mapping and rendering capabilities which is being marketed as re dot imagine call home fashions this reflects a spirit of innovation in our mattress fabrics business we are also enhancing our service platform as part of our ongoing efforts to be more responsive to customer demand with shorter lead time and we are implementing a new inventory management process which we believe will drive greater control i'm especially pleased sandy brown our long time cfo in the mattress fabric segment is now president of the division having worked with sandy for over twenty years i'm confident she has the experience expertise and the vision to lead this business as we strive to operate our strong platform in the most efficient matter looking ahead there are many opportunities to advance our position as a leading provider of mattress fabrics and sound covers we believe we will benefit from our recent and ongoing efforts to further our design and service capabilities with advanced technologies that support our sales and marketing efforts with both legacy and new customers now turn to the pulse street fabric segment our pulse street fabric business was affected by slow down in shipments heading into the chinese new year holiday resulting in lower than expected sales for the quarter it's difficult to predict the impact of the holiday shutdown from the year to year and this year we experienced a greater than expected decline in january leading up to the holiday period as a result we showed a modest drop in sales compared with a very strong performance in the prior year period in light of the uncertain business environment we faced we are pleased with the overall performance of our policy fabric business particularly given a comparison to a very strong quarter last year in fiscal twenty nineteen we have a strong platform in china and stable longterm or supplier relationships with vendors that prioritize our production due to those strong relationships this has been an important advantage recall especially as we resumed operations at the end of the third quarter following an extended government mandated shutdown in china associated with coronavirus outbreak we believe this platform supports our ability to manage the current disruptions created by the southbreak and the procedures required by the chinese government also our addition of cutting so capabilities in vietnam toward the end of fiscal twenty nineteen has further augmented our asian platform throughout fiscal twenty twenty we have continued to execute our strategic focus introducing new products and and diversifying our customer base we are especially pleased with the continued growth in our hospitality business as we've extended our reach in the growing market read window products our window treatment and installation services business has been a key driver of our growing sales in this business and we are excited about the continued growth opportunities as we expand our product portfolio to the hospitality market product innovation is also a hallmark of our success in the marketplace and provide the distinct competitive advantage for core our line of highly durable stain resistant this smart fabric continues to be very popular with both existing and new customers we are excited about the demand trends for this smart evolve our recently introduced line of sustainability it's fabrics featuring the use of recycled yards along with the strain stain resistant performance looking ahead while the business environment remains uncertain with the health issues surrounding the coronavirus in china and beyond we believe we are what position to execute our strategy with favorable results we have a unique combination of innovative products creative designs a growing customer base across both residential and hospitality markets and a global platform to support our business and be changing customer demands as such we remain confident in our ability to deliver another solid performance in our poster fabrics business in fiscal twenty twenty lastly all comment on the results for cold home accessories which includes our e-commerce and finished products business offering betting accessories and home goods we have worked hard to refine our strategy and drive improve results for our home accessory segments while it is taking a lot of them we expected to reach our initial projections for this business we encourage by re some opportunities with new online marketplaces and business to business sales channels we also remain dedicated to improving our performance on amazon which is a principal sales channel for our legacy e-commerce business in tandem with these strategies we are continuing to develop new products between cold mattress fabrics and the wall street fabrics and we are pleased with a very solid showing of the new products at the recent las vegas market we remain optimistic about potential growth opportunities for cold tummy accessories and the ability to leverage this new important sales channel to reach new customers for call ken will now review the outlook for fourth quarter and move into some questions importantly our expectations for the fourth quarter as soon the coronavirus outbreak does not have a greater than anticipated impact on the company's operations which may affect each of the company's divisions to varying levels we are monitoring the situation daily and following the processes and procedures provided for in the company's global pandemic disease contingent plan to protect our workforce however the potential impact with the coronavirus is difficult to estimate reasonably at this point given the validity and circumstances related to the disease and the actual being taken to continue spread subject to those assumptions and limitations we expect overall sales to increase slightly compared with the fourth quarter of last year we expect mattress fabric sales to be slightly down compared with the fourth quarter of last year due to continuing market pressure and stop this in our legacy business during the fourth quarter while operating income and margins are expected to increase slightly compared with the prior period in our poster fabric segment we expect fourth quarter sales and our breaking income in march to be slightly higher than the prior period in our home assessory segment we expect fourth quarter sales to be comparable to the fourth quarter of last fiscal year we expect an operating loss for the fourth quarter but with significant improvement compared to the prior year period and continued quarter over four is the clinical improvement for this fiscal year considering these factors the company expects report pre-faxed income for the fourth quarter and the range of one point nine million the two point four may and excluding restructuring and related charges of credits other non-recurring charges and impairment charges if any pre-tax income for last year's fourth quarter was one point five million which included a non-recurring charge of five hundred thirty dollars including this charge pre-tax income for the fourth quarter of last year was two million dollars based on our current projection capital expenses for this fiscal year are now expected to be in the six million the six point five million range appreciation and amorization is expected to be approximately eight point six million additionally pre-cash flow for this fiscal year is expected to be moderately down as compared to last year's results with that we will now take your questions thank you if you'd like to ask a question please signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you're using a speaker phone please make sure your new function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again press star one to ask a question we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity signal for questions we'll take our first question from bobby griffin with raymond james please go ahead good morning everybody thank you for taking my questions in the morning about it so i guess that there's a lot more to talk about if um called out maybe having some cava production capabilities in vietnam and maybe can we expand on on what they're is capabilities to give you guys and what's the strategy to participate more in what i guess we can call the asia import market from mattresses back into the us right thank you bobby this is here i'll take that question uh um you know you have to go back a little bit as we think about both anti-dumping and tariffs um you know which feels like you know now we're not even talking about that anymore but that was a pretty significant disruption over the last year the section three over of tariffs the rules for a pollstry and mattress fabrics are are quite different so the reason we are looking primarily to establish fabric manufacturing in vietnam is because today mattress fabrics have a fairly significant um and three oh one tariffs coming from china as do mattress covers um unlike furniture or a pulse street fabric where we can shift fabric from china to vietnam to avoid a tariff unless you make the full stone cover fabric all the way to cover in vietnam you still you would still pay the extra tariff so for us establishing in vietnam is a is a risk management play a cost saving play and certainly gives us ability to make covers that we can uh fulfill through vietnam that we can then sell into other countries that are making beds that end up in the us or bring fabric and covers of our own back to us in the us will help that answer that yeah that's very helpful i'm just curious from a competitive standpoint once you get this operation set up will those corresponding covers that you can now make and vietnam be competitively price to some of the covers that are already going on the inports uh in court of beds into the us today yes sir bobby we expect you we've been we've been very competitive with covers already mattress covers that we're making through our cold china platform uh has been very competitive and there are already opportunities materializing there but to be more advantageous to and to deal with us care rules and costs vietnam could be potentially potentially more advantageous in certain cases okay and then so for me on the home assessment business we talked about maybe improving some of the performance on the amazon channel so if we can maybe expand a little bit on those strategies and then secondly is there you know bigger opportunities to sell some of those finished products and retail locations uh yes sir bobby those are really good questions too um first i'll touch on the amazon part when we first invested in home accessories amazon was the full really the primarily primary part of the business up to eighty percent of the sales and we were really focused on that since the time we've invested has become more costly to do business and to rank higher to google ad words to just find yourself higher in the rankings and end up costing us more money than we might have expected so we've dialed back our offerings on amazon to really what we consider our core most stable most cost effective products and we're trying to do what we can see it to be an appropriate level of advertising so what we have placed on amazon today we believe we can service well it's a good quality product that should rank well and that we don't have to over advertise it and spend too much money to make it work so we're in amazon being a significant but more like a fifty percent share of our business and not not such a heavy piece uh for certain we have great opportunities and all of our accessory products on the b2b side uh we have a lot of customers that's a real pack that in customers that are looking for products to tack on and have additional sales accessories we also had a chance to sell some of our products into some retail direct distribution and that is working um sometimes it's never as fast as we want it to be cause it takes time to to get in the retail cycle but we are very optimistic about that opportunity also all right i appreciate you taking my questions here that was very helpful that's still walking the next quarter yes sir thank you once again that is star one to ask a question if you find that your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two again star one to ask question we'll take our next question from paul that's with stephen uh good morning everyone um continuing the amazon you mentioned some new sellers or violating uh terms um can you explain what's going on there and maybe if that gets rectified you may uh lose some or seen less competition yes sir well um paul thank you for the question in here i'll i'll take that too um basically what's what's happened since we first started with amazon and there's been a lot of stories in the press about this there have been times where primarily chinese sellers have flooded the marketplace on commodity items mattress protectors and mattress pads and things that we specialize in and amazon has pretty specific terms of service the way you the way you acquire a fast star reviews we have a lot of reviews that we've earned through study um normal processes selling out a to get reviews it's not really in terms of service to be doing a lot of free giveaways and fabricating reviews and also to be downgrading competitors with fake reviews which we have found instances of all those things and we have reported on it's really high levels in amazon and made some headway so amazon is working really hard to change their method the way they rank suppliers and i think in time that will get better but it's a pretty it's a pretty long site for someone like us to make a big impact really quick but that's what we mean by terms of service violation it's really fabricated and falsified reviews primarily okay thanks and the cap x was reduced um the is that just to conserve cash or what areas uh did you might uh lower that um yeah paul this can um yeah we we looked at the year and given our cash position we started prioritizing projects and so you know we have a certain amount of what we call maintenance capex which is in that six million or so range uh so um when you look at where we're ending up projected end up and then uh looking forward i mean we are going to to in this time of uncertainty we are going to prioritize projects and and as we say keep a very close eye on our cash but uh we will continue to invest in the business as we always have and we'll just have to uh you know just monitor things closely and and prioritize projects as they come along okay thanks and lastly um the course margins in the mattress segment um a little below expectations down your review is that just the disruption from uh the holiday shutdown or is there anything else going on there no that's that's a good that's a good uh insight there the uh obviously the lower sales uh had an impact but there were a lot of uh moving parts with the shutdowns and all that uh in the quarter and uh so that was the the primary reason for the marshall being down you know the lower sales and the other disruption as well it's okay thank you very much thank you we'll take our next question from marco rodriguez with stonegate capital markets please go ahead uh good morning guys thank you for taking my questions yeah good morning i was wondering if maybe you could talk a little bit more about the expansion activities that you're doing here in vietnam and haiti if you could just maybe place a timeline as far as when these capabilities you will be there and then and then the cost associated with those yes sir thanks for the questions marco and uh expansions in vietnam and and haiti um are are both really targeted for the mattress to average business in terms of the expansion standpoint we're already operating pretty significantly in vietnam for our full street cutting flow kits uh and that's performing well uh haiti you know we talk about a two prong strategy a really three prong strategy for that interest covers you know we have our us business that is a prototyping and quick rollout and emergency recovery platform that works well for us uh haiti is a very low-cost opportunity that we see um often a near sourcing uh potential so we're able to drive uh significantly faster lead times in haiti it's been a really resounding success for so far and we're just expanding the building so um it's not a significant expense you know we're just building some extra space and add some more selling machines getting into cut and so it's not a heavy capex venture so we would anticipate being in that plant and having additional capacity this summer it's a pre fast uh pretty fast uh uprising there and we're excited about haiti the good part about it is we can bring fabrics from anywhere in the world today um and if it's shown in haiti and comes back to us there's no duty on any of the products in are out so very advantageous platform that should provide us with uh faster lead times if we forecast and store inventory the right places uh vietnam is really an important ability for us to dabble with mattress fabrics in a small way we we will start start small mainly focused on serving asian customers uh and that's our attempt to get after some of the beds that are being made in asia and we can do that uh with both fabric or with the sun master cover uh if we need to we also have the ability to bring some of that back to the us um not preferred on a lead time basis but it could be good for cost um and we'll just do that on an as needed basis and we would avoid a section three oh one got it understood and then in terms of the um uh the service platform um additions or enhancements that you're taking a look at in the in the new inventory management uh can you maybe expand a little bit more on what sort of impact if any you might see on the pnl and or the balance sheet with those well what i'm not like i'll let can comment on the impact but i'll tell you the way the reason we're thinking about it is the mattress industry always for a long time was a pretty quick speed to market business where we pretty much inventory shift everything same day and we still do that for a big part of the market but as things have gotten more than with important mattresses and important components you know lead times have gotten a little longer so we've tried to then match our platform with all the multi countries that we're in us canada china haiti vietnam and in our sourcing business in turkey we wanna bring lead times back down even with that global strategies so our anticipation would not be to get out of the longer lead times that we've had recently shorten those lead times down so we're not caught with so much exposure on water if market conditions change so we're just our intention is to bring a better efficient management of our scheduling um faster lead time to customers to make them happy and then reduce our exposure for extra inventory yeah marco this can and that's uh i mean that's you know the extra inventory we we were expecting obviously a better quarter than we had so we built up inventory that those sales didn't material uh didn't materialize but now with this new focus uh we should be able to get inventory down and and and keep it in line um more consistently which will obviously help improve the cash flow in the fourth quarter but uh we're excited about the new process and uh you know hopefully don't get back in the situation where we build up inventory in anticipation of sales that that don't materialize so this is this is an exciting move and one that's uh that we're excited and anxious to get started i and last couple questions that's kind of a difficult one here on guidance um you know you've built in some sort of an impact for coronavirus um but just kind of curious if maybe you can put a little bit more color around what what does worse in conditions mean for you or look like are we talking um additional shutdowns in china um as far as the risk is concerned and i know that you also brought the fact that um obviously consumer confidence in us is is a big unknown um as it stands right now yeah marco i'll i'll i'll answer and then boy wants to jump in yeah it's it's uh forecasting in this environment and is is extremely difficult um you know we we put a lot of um language around the uncertainty um you know as you know everybody reads what happens daily the news comes out and so right now we are things are operating uh well in china uh things have are recovering uh so we've got uh that that news there but um you know things change daily so given where we are we we expect uh a good quarter in the fourth quarter but uh as as i said things can change quickly and and uh we'll just have to wait and see now we've got processes and systems that we can react to and and make changes and be flexible in our in our flexible platforms but uh it's just a very very uncertain time right now and so we're just uh being very cautious in how we forecast well i don't know if you want to yeah i'll add to that can thank you marco just in relation to the current situation for the poster side in china um as we've relayed we've really seen a return now to um mostly normal situations very quickly getting act normal situations there uh we had a uh one week delay in our uh china operation um a government mandated one week delay before we were able to get back to operating and then we've seen some delays from our supply base but currently uh nearly all of our suppliers are now back to almost full output again so the current situation is has been very positive uh we've experienced minimal delays and disrupt to supply to our customer base as a result um and so while it may remains a dynamic situation for sure and and uncertainty the current picture is uh china has recovered quite nicely and our supply that is back to near full output and so uh at the moment there appears to be minimal dislay just um relays coming from it all right thanks thanks luck i appreciate your time thank you thank you it appears there are no further questions at this time i'd like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks okay thank you operator and again thanks to everyone for your participation and your interest in call we look forward to updateing you on our progress next quarter have a great day this concludes today's call thank you for your participation you may now disconnect
