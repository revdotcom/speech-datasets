chief financial officer curtis steinin senior vice president and chief commercial officer and sidmack ally senior vice president and chief operating officer and now i'll turn the call over to karen thanks brandon good morning everyone yesterday we announced that we updated our twenty twenty financial guidance with net income and earnings for deleted share expected to be near the upper end of the ranges which are one hundred eighty six to one hundred ninety eight million for net income and three dollars forty four cents to three dollars sixty eight cents for earnings per share our guidance for capital expenditures and asset removal cost remains five hundred to five hundred twenty five million for the year turning to our actual results net income or the third quarter was twenty one point one million dollars or thirty nine cents per diluted share compared with seventeen point five million dollars or thirty three cents per deleted share in the same period twenty nineteen our third quarter results reflect an increase in net margin of five point two million over the same period last year which primarily due to three point seven million from new rates and two point seven million in residential sales from net residential customer growth offering costs for the third quarter were point eight million dollars higher compared to the same period last year this includes an increase at one point eight million in the expenses related to our response to the covid nineteen pandemic and at one point five million increase in employee related costs offsetting a portion of those cost increases is a reduction in expenses of dollars for travel and employee training costs that have been impacted by the pandemic we have not recorded any regulatory assets for financial accounting purposes pursuant to the accounting orders received in all jurisdictions that allow us to defer for regulatory purposes certain net increases and expenses and lost revenues due to covid nineteen we continue to evaluate whether amounts expected to be recoverable under these accounting orders are both measurable and probable recovery and will record such amounts for financial accounting purposes when we meet that hurdle our guidance for twenty twenty does no assume that we will record any regulatory assets by the end of the year our capital expenditures and asset removal costs decrease this quarter compared with the third quarter last year simply due to timing yesterday the one guest board of directors delivered dividends at fifty four cents <unk> authorized ray base reflecting our recent regulatory activity is approximately three point seven one billion as of september the thirtieth authorized rate base is defined as a rate base reflected and completed regulatory proceedings including full rate cases and interim rate filings we project that for twenty twenty our estimated average rate base which is defined as authorized rate base poor us additional investments in our system and other changes in the components of our rate base that are not yet reflected in approved regulatory filings will be approximately three point nine one billion with forty two percent of that in oklahoma twenty nine percent in kansas and twenty nine percent in texas we ended the quarter with adequate liquidity which includes approximately three hundred ninety one million dollars of capacity in our commercial paper program and all of the capacity under our two hundred fifty million three hundred sixty four day credit facility additionally as a over the thirtieth twenty twenty we've issued approximately thirteen million dollars of equity under the two hundred fifteen million at the market equity program we put in place earlier this year we have no plans to issue equity for the remainder of twenty twenty now alternative occurs for our regular time and commercial update thank you karen and good morning everyone first i'll provide an overview of recent regulatory activity and then provide an update on our commercial activities cancer's gas service filed a gas this number liability search charge or gs rs that seeks an increase in rate approximately seven point five million for capital expenditures incurred during the period covering july two thousand nineteen through june twenty two order from the kcc is expected in december twenty twenty with new rates going into effect in january texas gas service father rate case in december twenty nineteen for all customers in the central texas gold coast service areas seeking a rate increase and requesting to consolidate the two service areas in august the railroad commission approved all terms of a ten point three million settlement the as well as consolidation of the central texas service area and the gulf coast service area into a new central gulf service area this is a continuation of our strategy to consolidate jurisdictions which as a benefit to customers do primarily to a more efficient process with this latest consolidation we now have five jurisdictions in texas down from ten at the time of spinoff in two thousand routine moving on to our commercial activities during our second quarter analyst call i discussed the return to normal business levels for a couple of our large trade sport customers that a temporary retailed operations at the start of the pandemic and that we were not seeing any other significant disruptions with our transport customers for the third quarter twenty twenty our transport revenues and volumes were above the same period in twenty nineteen and on a year to date comparison between years our transport revenues have erased the second quarter twenty twenty impact and are now flat year over year we continue to see strong interest in natural gas from builders and developers capital spending to extend our service to reach new customers that the primary driver behind our increased capital expenditures can for twenty twenty as we described last quarter despite the pandemic we're seeing positive economic signs across our footprint particularly in texas and oklahoma as an example in the austin area are been over one hundred new business relocations for expansion announced thus far in twenty twenty which are expected to provide over fourteen thousand additional new jobs this increase in economic activity across our territories as resulted and continued growth in our customer base here to date we have average approximately twenty four thousand more sales customers than the same period last year this increase includes the connection of eighteen thousand six hundred new customers compared with fourteen thousand six hundred new customers in the same period last year or a twenty seven percent increase over last year's faith as i disc arrived during our last two quarterly analyst calls the impact of the moratoriums on disconnects for non-payment by our customers that expired in may in oklahoma and kansas and early october in some areas of texas has also impacted our average customer care and now i'll turn it over to sit for an update on operations thanks curtis our team in the field continues to adapt well to the current environment with maintenance and comp work on or ahead of schedule our supply chain remains uninterrupted and we see no forward constraints to our planned work thanks to study performance by our resource management team related to materials and contractors horses as karen mentioned while our capital spend was lower this quarter than the third quarter of last year the issue is timing rather than performance we've been pleased with the cadence of capital execution year to date with more consistent capital spend quarter to quarter than last year due to favorable weather and improved planning by our asset management engineering and field operations teams we remain on track to meet our capital expenditure guidance as discussed earlier and now i'll turn it over to peers thank you karen for this and said the pandemic has changed many things for many people our homes have become the place where we spend more and more time our customers take comfort in the warmth of our that our product provides especially as we head into colder weather as we near the end of the year it's natural to reflect on how we how far we've come for me three things stand out our resiliency adaptability and commitment to safety our performance this year demonstrates the resiliency of our business model and the continued value of natural gas as a preferred energy source for homes and businesses this year we were able to grow our customer base improve system integrity and established a remote workforce a myth great adversity despite that challenges brought on by the pandemic our industry is a custom to frontline response across our organization we quickly implemented additional safety protocols and new processes designed to keep our employees and our customers so during the pandemic thanks to the adaptability and diligence of each employee we've continued providing service to our customers with minimal disruptions finally in closing i'd like to recognize the one gas employees and get each of them a special thank you for their continued professionalism under stress resolve when there's no clear end in site employees in the face of uncertainty we'll get through this pandemic are relying on the values that we anchor our company to as we address the challenges that face our business thank you all for joining us this morning operator we're now ready for questions all right if you would like to ask a question you may signal by pressing star one on your telephone keypad if you were using a speaker phone please make sure your mute function is turned off to allow your signal to reach our equipment again meta star one to add ask a question and we'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal all all right and the first question is from richard <unk> with bank of america hey good morning can you hear me okay we can good morning richard hey thanks for taking my question um i'm just curious how you guys are are thinking about um covid and into peak winter heating season here and and i realize ogs has a higher proportion of residential versus transport customers but how are you uh thinking about factoring the lingering impact especially with the resurgence of cases as you could begin to look at your twenty twenty one outlook and the moving pieces and maybe just also comment on the equity needs into next year as well richard it said let me start and sort of curtis for the commercial part of that question and then karen can come in on the end in terms of the financing question uh we have been preparing for winter uh since march we understood that there was a high probability that we would see a second wave and that we would see some co-mingling of covid and the flu so our medical protocols were built with that in mind we have not seen constraints in our service territories and our employees have done a remarkable job of proactively participating in our medical program to make sure that we could provide them with the best medical advice to keep them and their families and our customers safe but also to allow us to tamp down any widespread unavailability of employees in any of our service territories so we feel like we're well prepared um we don't say that spiking the ball on the fifty we recognize that there is a challenging time ahead of us but we think we're as well prepared as we can be so let me toss to curtis to respond to the commercial question that's richard on on the commercial side of things um as you know we have a very high percent of our of our customer base being residential um and then uh about twelve percent that's our transport customers so one of the things that uh i noted in my comment is that we're really not seeing an impact at this point from our transport customers so we seem to have returned to a normal level of operations and have actually closed the gap uh with the activity we saw in the third quarter uh closing the gap from uh what we saw during the the second quarter of issue i'm on the residential side of things uh i think we're well prepared in our customer call centers to uh to handle the the call volume that we typically run into this time of the year one of the good things about the moratoriums being lifted when they were at the end of may for oklahoma and in kansas and a little bit later in texas is that while those moratoriums were in place sids operations teams were able to divert those resources is to handle a lot of our other normal annual activities and to get some of those things get ahead of those activities such that when the moratoriums were lifted we were able to focus more of our resources on the disconnect process which helped with our collections through that period so uh several factors that we had to to remain agile to handle during the year but uh cooperation and the work between our commercial operations teams helped us work through that part of it to be ready when we could again resume disconnects and that's helped our overall process the last piece i would say is um as karen talked about we do have the regulatory accounting orders in each of our juris uh will continue to monitor the activities for increased expenses as well as areas where we've been able to decrease expenses um so that and and continue to accumulate those until we're able to uh go through the regulate court process to begin recovery of those so i'll pick up on the financing question we have not updated our longer term guidance for financing which currently is that we anticipate eight hundred fifty to nine hundred million dollars of work with about a quarter of that being equity when we issue our guidance for twenty twenty one which we expect to do probably sometime at the first of the year we'll provide a closer look on what twenty twenty one looks like okay got it that's the that's very helpful appreciate all the color there and maybe just uh switching gears here obviously with uh elections on top of mind just curious how uh you're you're thinking about decarbonization goals and just given really some of the um potential for electrification and buildings and some of the supply and cost constraints on the r and d side i mean is that really the solution or or is green hydrogen potentially more likely candidate just just maybe curious if you can provide some thought uh overall um on timing and when we can see more formal adoption of these technologies another good question richard um this is curtis again so on the on the commercial side i've talked before about efforts we've had around renewable natural gas um there are several different projects and developers that we're talking to um some already capture r and g and use it for alternative uses uh what we may be able to bring to the table is the opportunity to improve the commercial economics of that capture gas so by bringing it into our system and getting it tracked through to be used as replacement for diesel for other product through conference natural gas and so we're continuing to uh explore and uh hopefully we'll be in a position that we have some of those projects as we move into next year uh we've proven the um the commercial ability of those projects that we've established the gas standards and everything that we would need to do to bring that product into our system so you know we continue to make progress on that we're also uh in an h two at scale project with the university of texas it's in other parties including the doe to run some different scale projects of converting or producing hydrogen both from renewable power as well as from landfill gas and then using that that hydrogen that's produced to run a computer center at the university of texas as well as provide fuel for hydrogen fuel cell vehicles so we're continuing to that project i just started earlier in the mid-part actually of twenty twenty so it's about a three-year project but the promising results come out of that and i'm gonna turn it to sit and he can talk a little bit more about what we're doing and what we're seeing on the offer relationships that's analyzing the fact that yeah richard thank you for the question as you know there is a commercial component to this an r and d component as you point out but there are also some practice whole implications uh that companies need to consider as as emergent opportunities like hydrogen start to be developed uh we have two working groups in place currently one it's looking at technical issues including the engineering implications you know there will be policies and procedures around hydro hydrogen use and there are also some system integrity implications to make sure that you can introduce hydrogen at the proper blending rate and handle that safe in terms of continuing to focus on safety of our system the second is a really interesting working group that's looking at the gas supply implications a hydrogen is a different material to come press and transport and so the location of manufacturing facilities comes into play we're scoping all of that right now and excited about continuing the conversation all right thanks very much for all the call that's all i have all right once again that is star one to ask a question if you find your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two the next question is from and i apologize if i say this incorrectly <unk> with ubs good morning good morning i got could could you give us an update on bed dead and how is it trending this year as we head into winter sure good morning i got this here so we're still uh trying to describe some of our collections activity uh that's still uh still at play so um we're not out of the the covid uh impact certainly by a long stretch we currently um are point eight million about that expense through the nine months that compares to four point six million dollars last year so we're up about four million year over year um and again uh we just work to monitor the situation we there are more more towards in place in some of the service areas and so until we get completely back to normal collections activities for an extended period of time it's gonna be difficult to really determine what the impact has been and how does changing congress related to eliminating state income taxes from rates could impact uh wind up as cash flow going forward and expected to have a material impact and then scheme of things that's not a large in our overall tax picture the elimination of the state income tax is not a large event okay last question for me to pull up on research questions the carbonization is there a regulatory framework in place um to invest in r and g a your jurisdiction we have targets established to potentially cover some additional costs related to investments in r and d and equality helpful greg this is curtis um r and g is actually contemplated in the tariffs in texas uh it is a a recoverable gas cost there um so that that was that has previously been contemplated as part of the gas supply picture in oak there was legislation introduced in the last session uh to compel the commission to study r and g and to look at ways to um to to bring r and g into the oklahoma gas supply with the pandemic starting that was not a bill that was considered all the way through session uh but outside of that the oklahoma corporation commission has opened up a notice of inquiry uh looking at several different in energy questions one of which is renewable natural gas and the and the way that the state and the commission should deal with that product so uh there are efforts um underway at the at the state levels also uh not as much at this point in kansas um but uh the other two states are a little bit further along in that regard thank you for calling and stay safe thank you guys all right and once again that is star one to ask a question okay and it appears there are no further questions at this time mr lucy i'd like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing remarks thank you all again for your interest in one gas our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts we close our books in early january and extends until we release earnings in february we'll provide details on the conference call later date have a great day this concludes today's call thank you for your participation you may know i disconnect
