call instructions will be given for the question and answers session if anyone anyone needs assistance at any time during the conference please press a star key followed by zero on your telephone as a reminder this conference call is being recorded today wednesday november fourth twenty twenty i would not like to turn the call over to ms lee and suverts of shelton group investor relations please go ahead good afternoon and welcome to side times third quarter two thousand two funny financial results conference call on the call from side time or just assist chief executive officer and art chadwick chief financial officer before we begin i'd like to point out that during the course of this call the company may make forward looking statements regarding expected future results including financial position strategy and plans future operations the timing market and other areas of discussion it is not possible for the company's management to predict all risks nor can the company assess the impact of all the factors on its business or that it's extent to which any factor or combination of factors they cause actual results to different materials from those contained in any forward looking statement in light of these risks uncertainties and assumptions the forward looking events discussed the even this call may not occur in actual results could differ materialally and adversely from those anticipated or implied needs that the company nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward looking statements the company undertakes no obligation to put quickly update for looking statements for any reason after the date of this call to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectations for more detailed information on risk associated with our business we'll refer you to the risk factors described in our nk filed on march second two thousand twenty as well as the company's subsequent filings with scc also during this call we will refer to certain non-cap financial measures which we consider to be an important measure of company performance these non-cap financial measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with us gaps the only difference between gap and non gap result is stock based compensation expense but please refer to the press release issue today for detailed reconciliation between our gap and non gap financial results i'd now like to turn the call over to <unk> please go ahead thank you lien uh good afternoon we appreciate you joining us today and hope that all of you and your families are staying safe and healthy during these unique times even with a challenging macro backdrop site time continue to execute demonstrated by a record quarterly revenue of thirty two point seven million for third quarter twenty twenty which was above our updated guidance range of thirty one two thirty two million our results demonstrate the diversity of our end market segments our customer base and the exceptional dedication of site in all of which have benefited site and during the current environment during this third quarter revenue grew fifty two percent sequentially compared to our second quarter twenty twenty revenues we anticipate that continues to ranked in the fourth quarter will allow for some time to set another quarterly revenue record and art's going to discuss our third quarter financials and fourth quarter outlook later in the call now sometimes fabulous model in healthy source strategy continue to provide a competitive advantage in this market while at the same time providing added assurance of quality and reliability to our customers in contrast we believe that the course industry infrastructure has several point failure which can cause supply disruptions some of which we have heard about through recent industry commentary additionally within the timing market responsiveness is becoming the key team and we believe that many competitors in courts may not be set up to support industrial needs and requirements for the future in infrastructure applications are speed of response to environmental disruptors such as temperature change minimizes the system level impact in mobile iot our <unk> products help reduce radio power by turning it on and off more quickly and precisely something that's unique to site time on the supply side our programmability continues to enable the flow ability speed and delivery required by our customers with the recent introduction of our apex men's family of resonator products site time now offers all three categories of timing products which are the automators the clocks and the resonators as of the third order we accumulatively shipped on two billion oscillators all of them with an embedded men's resonator are combined knowledge of the men's the analog chips the package and the materials is unique to the industry and offers a system level understanding for our resonator customers as well now we know that the manufacturing men's products and high volume is not easy men's product leaders in other markets non-timing markets maintain their leadership position because they invested early focused on developed innovative solutions at a rapid pace as well and we believe today that site time is in a similar position for the timing market the as we continue to build upon this market leadership our apex manager resonators are ideally suited for high volume space constrain mobile and iot applications such as bluetooth terribles high speed connected the interfaces asset tracking and microcontrollers in addition to these applications other system on a chip vendors can use our apex sms resonators that would be co-packaged with their chips just like we do in our automators given a broad knowledge of timing market solutions across all three categories we believe our system timing our system level timing solutions save customer design time increase their end products performance and reliability while also reducing their overall board footprint creating value moving to 5g in 5g the opportunities available to site and continue to drive the company's expansion into the communications market our products continue to see solid design traction in 5g applications at tier one manufacturers of telecommunication equipment in addition we previously mentioned o r a n which is open radio x as networks and we continue to see significant interest in oran hardware solutions that are being developed for greenfield operators as well as the traditional carriers oran is getting traction because it gives operator best in class equipment and performance while driving better deployment economics and the need for successful interoperability of equipment from different suppliers is a driving factor for sidetime success we're getting significant traction with orient customers worldwide across the entire radio networks including ru small cell and distributed units in the area of 5g optical transport where we are engaged with hundred to eight hundred g optical and soc suppliers with our s i t nine five zero five nine five zero one products we find that we are able to offer unique value with high performance in the smallest form factor in conclusion site time is uniquely positioned to disrupt the market as the first company that continues to provide system level timing solution that said the is the only the first step of a multi-year strategy to extend our market leadership in timing solution we remain a results-driven company with a culture that encourages creativity leadership and a strong commitment to our customers which continues to be reflected in our recent quarterly plans i'd now like to turn the call over to art as we'll discuss as he will discuss in more detail our third quarter results and our outlook for the fourth quarter art thanks <unk> good afternoon everyone we are very pleased to be holding our fourth financial results conference call as a public company and during my review today i'll discuss third quarter twenty twenty financial results and we'll provide guidance for the fourth quarter i'll focus my discussion on non-cap financial results and refer you to today's press release for a detailed description of our gap results as well as reconciliation of gap to non-cap results which exclude stock-based compensate and related payroll tax expense so first of all q3 was really an excellent quarter for us we had strong revenue growth significant gross margin expansion and very positive on gap net income as you know at the end of august we increased our revenue guidance for the quarter by more than ten percent and i'm happy to report that actual results exceeded the high end of that revised guidance revenue for the quarter was thirty two point seven million of fifty two percent sequentially and up twenty nine percent over the same quarter a year ago to provide some color and markets a report sales by market group as i have in the asked the first is mobile iot and consumer which consists primarily of sales into mobile phones wearable devices and consumer products this was the segment most impacted by the global slow down in q2 but it came back strong in q3 sales were twenty point nine million or sixty seven sixty four percent of total sales up one hundred and five percent sequentially and up nineteen percent over the same quarter a year ago the second is industrial automotive and aerospace which goes into industrial automotive aerospace military applications and includes broad based sales sales for six point four million or twenty percent of sales of five percent sequentially and up twenty three percent over the same quarter a year ago the third is communications in enterprise which consists of wireless infrastructure including 5g data center and networking this was the fastest growing segment over the same quarter last year sales were five point four million for sixteen percent of sales of three percent sequentially and up one hundred and three percent year over year we had just one end customer where sales exceeded ten percent in sales to that customer were forty five percent of total sales we've had a number of initiatives within the company to expand rose margins and those initiatives are paying off non-cap rose margins during the quarter were fifty two point one percent of five hundred hundred and thirty basis points over q2 non-cap operating expenses were twelve point five million dollars of five percent sequentially comprised of seven point zero million in r and d and five point five million in sg in a expense that interest expense was zero point one million dollars and this generated non-cap net income of four point four million or twenty three cents per share and that's compared to a loss in the prior quarter of two point two million or fourteen cents a share stock-based compensation expense related payroll tax over five point one million this was hired in the three point four million in q2 due to the higher stock price some new higher stock grants and the establishment of an executive performance stock bonus plan trade receivables were seventeen point two million that was up from thirty point zero million in q2 due to the higher revenue but dsos decreased from fifty eight days in q2 to just forty nine days in q3 inventory was fifteen point two million dollars up slightly from fourteen point eight million in q2 we generated four point two million in cash from operations and used two point five million for the purchase of assets we had thirty five million in banked it going into the quarter but we paid this off entirely and finished the quarter with no bank then we then ended the quarter with sixty nine point two million in cash and equivalence i'd now like to provide some guidance for the fourth quarter of twenty twenty we expect two four to be another great quarter with continued sequential revenue growth gross margin expansion and increasing that income we expect fourth quarter revenue will be up ten to fifteen percent sequentially at the mid point this would put revenue at about thirty six per and eight million dollars or thirty percent higher than the same quarter last year we expect continued gross margin expansion with non-gat rose margins increasing to approximately fifty three percent plus or minus a point operating expenses are expected to increase between eight and ten percent sequentially which at the mid point would be approximately thirteen point seven million dollars we will not incur any interest expense since we no longer have any bank debt income taxes will be nominal and less than fifty k for the quarter the basic share count in q4 will be approximately seventeen point zero million shares in addition to dilute of impact of employee rsu will add approximately two point two million shares taken the total diluted share count used for our eps calculation to approximately nineteen point two million shares stock based compensation expense will be approximately five and a half million dollars up from q3 due to the higher stock price and a few new higher grants so based on the guidance just given we expect fourth quarter non-gaps will be between twenty eight cents and thirty two cents per share so in summary we have an exceptional workforce it is performing extremely well working from home we have truly differentiated products that address large and growing markets we have a number of new products in the pipeline an enviable list of tier one customers a strong balance sheet and we're looking forward to a very strong q4 so with that i'd like to turn the call back to the operator for q and a operator at this time i would like to inform everyone in order to ask a question please press this part one on your telephone keypad again this is part one to ask a question we have our first question from blaine curtis from barkley your line is open good afternoon guys this is tom <unk> for blaine curtis congrats on the really nice results uh my first question was around uh the improvement throughout the quarter obviously you updated guidance in late august and then you're you're now coming ahead of that range now um what most material improved between now and then uh and then if you could look out into december you're obviously guiding for some more expansion there could you give us a little color on segments uh between the three where you're seeing that growth so so from q2 to q3 as as i mentioned the most significant growth was in our mobile iot group right part of that is seasonality but um we just had real straight kind of across the board with our customers in that in that segment we also mentioned in our revised in our press release with our revised gardens in august that we had won a design win a phone design win that all so contributed um you know we're not gonna report the the uh the phone revenue specifically one because we're not allowed to but i will provide some color to that when we increased our guidance in august about half of that increased was related to that new phone design win and the uh the balance was obviously then uh strength in non-phone so that that was kind of what happened in the third quarter in the fourth quarter we're seeing very strong revenue growth uh as i mentioned our guidance is that revenue will be up ten to fifteen percent uh i'll mention the phone again not specifically but phone revenue will probably account for about a third of that seat essential improvement um and therefore non-phone uh basically accounts for the balance of that but we're we're expecting uh growth in all of our market segments going from q3 to q4 great that's super helpful and my fault is just really around uh the the largest customer for you guys that obviously stepped up material into september uh along with that margins clearly stepped up as well can you talk about what's driving that better margin performance clearly you're you're seeing some creative grow margin dollars uh as that customer steps up but uh can you talk to your other segments as well is is there a material part of that uptick that's also coming from the coms enterprise in the auto industrial space as well as as those products move a little move a little oh absolutely ab absolutely you know we've talked for a long time about the gross margin drivers uh in our business um you know our newer products generally are higher asp and higher performance uh as as those newer products become a larger percentage of our sales that drives higher blended gross margins that's one two we're taking more of our sales direct that cuts out the distributor uh that improves our gross margins uh we've made a lot of progress and reduced and our product material costs that would be way for a cost uh that improves gross margins our ops group has done a great job of improving sort and test yields and package costs that improves gross margins volume helps us our or manufacturing overhead even though we're fabulous we have a certain amount of manufacturing overhead that's relatively fixed so as the volume goes up that manufacturing overhead is percent of sales decreases that helps gross margins and so you we've been working on this now for for a while and you know we saw very significant gross margin expansion from q2 to q3 as i mentioned gross margins increased five hundred and thirty basis points from q2 to q3 and and i've guided for at least another point of improvement plus or minus going from q3 to q4 great congrats again on the next results guys thank you thank you we have your next question from <unk> from <unk> your line's open yes thank you and uh congratulations on the record results um <unk> you called out some some challenges in the uh in the courts industry you know your competitors could you maybe elaborate a little bit more on that and um what what does that really mean for sort of new engagements and new designments for for cycle yeah i think we talked a little bit about it last time uh basically the courts industry as we know has done a seller job in the last seventy years of providing uh product to everybody in the electronics world uh but i think uh that it is still a bash for it is a fab process it's a factory process or everybody has to invest in factories and these factories are purpose made so they can't be used for anything else they don't have the scale and they don't have the flexibility that a fabulous come mean like site time which uses semiconductors uh can get i mean as a reminder um uh when we build our men's resonators we can um uh a million uh sorry uh ten thousand wafers should give us about a billion units and these a hundred eighty nanometer technology wafer so not really that difficult to get so it's fundamentally their supply chain is batch made and i think it has these issues with it there were some reports of some stumbles in fabs in uh in in the asian markets and i think we saw a spike in demand coming that didn't impact two three by the way i'm just talking uh that we we saw spikes in people because people get nervous when that happens and this is the first time ten years ago there was uh a big um uh a big problem with ceramic packaging as you know all courts with products where the osulators are very the natures are court packaged because to because they're fragile and they want to to keep a very strong packaging those courts packaging ceramic packages come from only two people in the world and sometimes there's a so i think they have these multiple points of failure potentially um and uh that's what i was pointing out to and yeah there have been some uh there have been some you know anecdotal uh events in the last few months and in the continuing we expect to see that um it's just a it's just a reminder to our customers it doesn't significantly change our revenue but what it does is in this medium to longer term it gets our customer a reminder that they they're probably better off in moving to more stable supply chains yeah that's that's great perspective thank you for that and that's my followup uh congratulations on entering the the resonator market and and now obviously you're you're covering the target of the timing market and then in the past you've talked about uh targeting about a ten billion dollar time if you kind of combine all three sub segments um could you update us where you're now uh with your uh penetration with new products into the resume market yeah our sam is still around a billion to a billion point two it might be a little bit higher depending on when when we introduce products and so on but the certainly less than two billion uh it's also mostly concentrated right now in um in oscillators so while we do have resonators that have been introduced while we do have um uh analog clocking solutions that have been introduced are ramp into that from a revenue point of view we have already set expectations will be relatively slow i think our entry into these markets is significant for customers um in the following way in the way that they can then come and have conversations with us on all of these products and not every customer wants to talk to us about every one of them sometimes they want to talk to us only about resonators or automators or or clocking and then that becomes an entry point to talking about other products so it's a it's from a tam point of view we're still pretty tiny uh you know one and a half billion in tam out of eight billion total market sam at one and a half billion sam or about eight eight billion total sam and of course sometimes revenue is you know still pretty pretty small in comparison you know at around a hundred million um so we still even if we maintain and did not grow our sam very much we would still probably have a long way to go before we fill out those boots thank you for that addition congratulations again great thank you we have your next question from queen bolton from meet him your life open hey guys congratulations on the on the nice results wanted to start off with the supply chain issues you talked about with courts i believe that was one of the factors that led to the to the phone the uh win that that you announced uh last quarter you know as you look forward do you think that those court supply chain issues position you to potentially win additional skews either at that customer or other large smart phone vendors i think that'll have some impact when uh but i don't think that it's forecastable uh i think it's a it's a general slow trend uh and i've talked about this several times it's a general slow and it's it's it's not at the point where it's gotten that snowball has become very big but it's a trend that we see and we've always said that people design us in for uh performance reasons as well as for supply chain but over willingly to design us for performance reasons uh just to just to pick up you know uh i would say less than fifteen percent of the time we get designed in uh for supply chain reasons but those supply chain reasons are important uh because when uh people look at their supply chains and see these motivations that happen from time to time and these by the way these motivations are not new they've been going on for for a long time but but customers did not have an alternative now that they do have an alternative it just becomes one more faster in their thinking particularly when they're looking further out in time particularly say for example in automotive or mill arrow uh or or uh or you know longer term industrial products that have a slow ramp in multiple years uh many of them start to think it might be prudent to do that um but i would still push on our performance benefits as being the primary reason for adoption great that second question i know um with the with the recent introduction of the apex ms family you're you're moving into the resonator more are you targeting select frequencies um you know where you know high volume frequencies with the initial resonators um and i guess related question you know since you designed this in silicon do you need new masks that's every time the frequency changes um in those resonator structures thank you yeah yeah absolutely uh we to answer a second question first we do need a new mask set um but um sometimes uh those are very similar uh they're not the the the the design of the resonator is not very different for example between twenty four meters seven twenty six megahertz it's not going to be very different however between a twenty four megahertz and uh seventy six point eight megahertz i think it could be different uh but uh generally the good news is that the the resonate industry has worked around the courts limitations in the past and there are basically a handful maybe two handful so call it a dozen quote unquote popular frequencies that exist and um and so i think uh that makes our task easier as we go from one frequency to the other and you're absolutely right we will not only target the most popular ones but we'll target the ones where the frequency is one thing but where we bring the combination of size of uh of of resilience of uh environmental stability and clearly of high volume because the their low price products they are sub twenty cent products and price and so obviously the volume has to be opportunity has to be in the tens of millions for it to be interesting for us um those are some of the key key reasons to do it now there's another thing that's going to happen uh over time as frequencies of socs increase um the the requirement for frequencies beyond say seventy five megahertz uh increases and that's an area where we think uh that court technology has uh has difficulty getting to uh a high volume high frequency high reliability small size product and the that's where also we would shine and i'm thinking two three four years out particularly in consumer products perhaps in phone applications got it great thank you for that additional detail and then just quickly for our you mentioned each each of the segments would grow in the fourth quarter just wondering if you might be able to rank order um if one's growing much much faster than the others would you expect all of them to grow about the same rate thank you sure fair fair question i don't think we wanted to get that detailed in our in our guidance we do expect growth in each one of those segments um and i'll leave it at that and we'll uh we'll announce that segment growth in more detail when we actually announce fourth quarter understand thanks eric thanks <unk> we have your next question from <unk> <unk> from russ capital your line's open i'm sorry our congratulations on the strong results so uh perhaps for art with the uh increasing mobile uh content that you have now can you miss a framework we're thinking about seasonality going forward first half first second half first q uh versus maybe before um you know coming into this here uh sure well if you look at the seasonality in our business and we do have seasonality go back to last year twenty nineteen right second half of the year much stronger than the first half people can go back and quantify that we saw pretty much the same thing this year um you know the back half of this year much stronger than the first half of this year q2 of course was was somewhat depressed in our mobile and iot segment because of the global slow down and the fact that so many retail stores were and i think next year it's gonna be somewhat similar uh in terms of first half versus second half obviously we expect uh uh year over year growth you know q1 next year should be nicely higher than q1 of this year and q2 over q2 and three and three and four and four so we we expect you know next year we'll have good growth we're not quantifying that at this point uh but in terms of the seasonality it's gonna look i think similar to how it looked last year and this year okay that's very helpful and then perhaps on the um the infrastructure side 5g uh wireless infrastructure in particular um are you having design winds kind of showing up every quarter that helped that be a steady growth driver or might you ebb and flow with the 5g build out uh puts in takes yeah i think it's a slow steady drum data products uh you know our uh our products are also showing up you know we talked about the ninety five oh one the uh in the optical module business that's clearly showing up uh the oren uh that i referred to earlier i think we have uh tens of uh design wins that showed up in the last uh in the last uh few months uh yeah so so it's just a steady growth and what i'm excited about is the breadth of where 5g touches so again as i've said it's not just the distribute the digital unit or the ru it's it's the mid hall the back hall the microwave the you know it's in the servers it's in it's all it's in so much of the infrastructure and as i've mentioned before this is probably a five seven year rollout and and that should be a very very solid place for side time okay helpful colors thank you <unk> okay we have your next question from all the center veggie from william player your line's open uh sure maybe a quick question for art um just on operating expenses can you update us on the long-term operating model and how we should be thinking about it you guys have really had our done tremendous job um growing revenue the last couple quarters with very little um opex flow through yeah so wondering how to think about it yeah great great great question well revenue kind of got ahead of our expenses so that that's a good thing you know our kind of stated longterm goal is that we would grow opex at about half the rate of top line growth so just for sake of mathematical example if we were to grow revenue year over year by twenty percent then i would expect opex to grow by about ten percent so that's kind of a generalized long-term goal if you look at the last couple of quarters um you know q2 our revenue went up fifty two percent sequentially but only five but opex only went up five percent sequentially so you know we we couldn't ramp expenses quite fast enough my guide for q4 uh we're guiding revenue up ten to fifteen percent and i'm guiding opex up eight to ten percent so that's a little more than uh half the top line rate but that's because of a little bit of a catch up because we were so low in terms of opex grows in q2 so does that does that kind of frame it for you uh yeah that helps um i i have a i have a common i have a comment on that and that comment is that um a reminder that sometimes an analog semiconductor company and when you think of other semiconductor companies that are using seven nanometer tapeouts uh we're doing one eighty one thirty sixty five nano meter tapeouts uh when you think of other companies doing a bunch of software in opex and scaling that um we are not in the software business or not meaningfully in that on the other hand uh the number of opportunities are coming at us are coming to be taken fast so we always would like to retain the ability to invest uh at a at a greater rate you know within reason um to the model that was sent out by art understood that's that's helpful and a helpful reminder on the um on the geometry um and then just one more question i believe last quarter when you announce the cascade product the clock i see product um that you expected revenue to really be you know a twenty twenty one event beginning um and then probably ramping um beyond that as we look at the standalone resonator products are we thinking about the timeframe to revenue in a similar fashion or what are the puts and takes to there from a customer standpoint yeah i would say that's even slower alex uh i would say that um you know because uh there's two kinds of design wins we would have we would have standalone design wins so we would go to uh oems and sell them resonators that's one uh and then the other one would be to go to soc vendors the ones we sort of for example gave and they would design it into their products both of them particularly the second one take a long time so the gestation period for that for meaningful revenue is easily twice as long as the clocking business the so um yeah so of course there can be other times when it can happen very fast but uh but generally that's a good rule of thumb okay um that's helpful uh that's it for me thank you thanks allen we have your next question from chris casto from raymond james your line's open yes thank you good evening um i guess question on on margins and um uh i guess as we forward into next year there's a lot of different factors with um uh seasonality uh some of the different margin profiles of the different segments that are gonna move in seasonality could you give us a sense of you know what what should we expect as we go through the year particularly in the first half of next year as some of the uh consumer-related products uh you know typically would be seenly weaker yeah great great question so you know our long-term goal for gross margins that we've talked about is getting gross margins somewhere closer to sixty percent and that's gonna take us two to three years give or take so you know to just kind of do that math you know we're we're targeting ghost margin expansion of maybe three points a year now we obviously did much better than that going from q2 to q3 but you know just for the next couple of years if we can add three points we get to sixty percent margin um you know in in two to of years within a year there are some dynamics that affect gross margins by quarter and you're right in the first half of the year generally our mobile iot and consumer business which is uh somewhat lower gross margins not at much lower but a little bit lower would argue that gross margins would be a little higher in the first half of the year just because of mix but the counter to that is we have this leverage on our manufacturing overhead so the lower volumes actually hurt us on that side so taking all of that into account just like we have dynamics this year of gross margins being nicely higher in the back half of the year versus the first half i would expect the same thing next year so you if you're modeling this i would model gross margins to what you think it would be for the year in total margins will be higher in the back half than they will be in the first half right and that's as the the the poor mix is off set by the higher uh uh manufacturing efficiencies in the second half of the year right and and the volume uh is is a little heavier waiting so uh i would actually expect gross margins to to pull back just a little bit in the first half of next year but i expect them to be much stronger in the back half of next year uh even stronger of course than they are in the back half of this year all right that's very helpful thank you um as a follow up um perhaps you could talk to us about you know kind of what you're targeting for next year there's a lot opportunities in front of you uh you know in terms of what do you expect what what do you expect to drive the growth next year and uh uh there there's a lot on your plate there's a lot of opportunity there what are the things we should be paying attention to to most closely as we go into next year um i think the market um that we the market trends that we have outlined continue so clearly comes a enterprise data centers are a big play um uh we are continuing to find uh more traction and automotive uh as more and more uh electric vehicles show up cause a lot of automated driving is happening in that uh we have a nice little story and connection growing in the middle aerospace market and then finally uh the mobile iot piece of it less the consumer or the mobile iot piece of it is always a natural place for sometimes growth uh because you know the size the resiliency the performance so i think uh we are also uh continuing to expand our customer base you know five years ago we were uh addressing about two thousand customers today we're about five x that maybe a little bit more and uh so i think the expansion of customer base this is not the big customers this is customers that are of a much much smaller size where we are working in the channel to to connect with them i think that's a that's a good initiative for site as well so i think those are some ways that we think okay great very helpful thank you great thanks chris i'm showing no further questions at this time i would like to turn the conference back to mr arthur chadway sir please continue great well we wanna thank everybody for joining us today on the call and uh we hope that you have a great day and um thanks again for all your support thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes today's conference call thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day you may all disconnect
