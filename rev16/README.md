# Rev16

The Rev-16 dataset ( also referred to as rev16 ) is a 16-hour corpus of English-language podcasts introduced by [Radford et al., 2023](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/radford23a.html).

The transcripts were created by Rev transcriptionists in two different styles, and are separated by subdirectory. The `verbatim` transcripts are created by the transcriptionists writing exactly what they hear, including filler words, stutters, interjections (active listening) and repetitions. The `nonverbatim` transcripts are created by lightly editting for readability. Without changing the structure or meaning of the speech.

For more information, see Rev's [Transcription Style Guide](https://cf-public.rev.com/styleguide/transcription/Rev+Transcription+Style+Guide+v4.0.1.pdf) on page 12-14.
