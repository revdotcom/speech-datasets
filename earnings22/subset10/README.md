# Earnings-22 Subset 10

The Earnings-22 Subset 10 dataset is an 11-hour corpus of ten English-language earnings calls collected from global companies. These files were randomly selected from the full Earnings-22 corpus.

The transcripts were created by Rev transcriptionists in two different styles, and are separated by subdirectory. The verbatim transcripts are created by the transcriptionists writing exactly what they hear, including filler words, stutters, interjections (active listening) and repetitions. The nonverbatim transcripts are created by lightly editing for readability without changing the structure or meaning of the speech.

For more information, see Rev's [Transcription Style Guide](https://cf-public.rev.com/styleguide/transcription/Transcription+Style+Guide+v5.pdf) on page 6-8.
