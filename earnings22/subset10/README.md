# Earnings-22 Subset 10

The Earnings-22 Subset 10 dataset is an 11-hour corpus of ten, English-language earnings calls collected from global companies. These files were randomly selected from the full Earnings-22 corpus.

The transcripts were created by Rev transcriptionists in two different styles, and are separated by subdirectory. The `verbatim` transcripts are created by the transcriptionists writing exactly what they hear, including filler words, stutters, interjections (active listening) and repetitions. The `nonverbatim` transcripts are created by lightly editting for readability. Without changing the structure or meaning of the speech.

For more information, see Rev's [Transcription Style Guide](https://cf-public.rev.com/styleguide/transcription/Rev+Transcription+Style+Guide+v4.0.1.pdf) on page 12-14.
